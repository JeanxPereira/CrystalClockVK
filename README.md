Crystal Clock VK is a clean reimplementation of the crystal clock screen of the PlayStation 2 OSD: twelve
glass rods around a sphere, seven orbs leaving trails, the framebuffer refracted through the blocks, the date,
the time and the button hint. The canon build is **HDD OSD 1.10U** (`hddosd.elf`, SHA-1 `e932f350…`); the
**ROM 2.30** BIOS is a second witness, and every address names the build it belongs to.

Nothing here is emulated. The scene code is ported from an executable JavaScript model of the console's own
functions, and that model is a fact only where a verifier recomputes the console's output from it, bit for bit,
on both builds. PCSX2's GS is used once more at the end, as a measuring rule: the scene drawn through a GS-exact
renderer gives the same frame as PCSX2 except for 8 pixels, all caused by PCSX2's own texture cache. The renderer
that runs in the window is free of the GS: hardware blending, MSAA in place of the GS's edge antialiasing, any
resolution.

US Patent 6,693,606 states the intent of the effect and holds no numbers; every number comes from the binary.
Crystal Clock VK is an independent project and is not affiliated with Sony Interactive Entertainment. The console's raw
resource files in `resources/` are Sony's.

## Features

| Area | What it does |
|---|---|
| Scene | The clock screen as plain C++ with named objects: state, camera, placement, rods, orbs, frame head, text. One `scene::Frame` per frame, no Vulkan |
| Exactness | The scene is a template over its arithmetic. `Clock<EeArithmetic>` (round toward zero, no denormals, the EE's own sine) reproduces the model bit for bit; the window runs `Clock<NativeArithmetic>` |
| Rods | The five sends of a rod: refracted, textured, reflection, the split rod and its texture offsets, the two extra passes |
| Orbs | Seven orbs on rings of 50 points, one point every 3 frames; trails drawn as the GS's one-pixel bands; sprites and their fade |
| Frame head | Background tube, blur trips, copies to the work buffers, tint, vignette, bars |
| Text | The FNTOSD font, the glyph cache carried from frame to frame, a glyph's twelve-vertex fan, date and time from the OSD's own format strings, the button hint |
| Native renderer | Vulkan 1.4, dynamic rendering, push descriptors; three targets (display, refraction source, work); fixed-function blending; MSAA off, 2x, 4x, 8x |
| Live window | SDL3 window on local time, logic at a fixed 59.94 Hz, 640x448, window size, x2 or x4, a 4:3 picture or square pixels |
| Debug panel | Dear ImGui: resolution, MSAA, pause, step one frame, set the time, show any target, screenshot |
| Measuring rule | On the `lab` branch: `GsParityRenderer` and `ParityTool`, the scene converted to GS draws and compared with PCSX2's software renderer against exact budgets |

## The method

The research lives on the `lab` branch (`facts/`, `References/`, the tests, the parity tools). A value enters the code only once it is a fact, and a fact is a verifier passing.

| Step | What happens |
|---|---|
| Measure | Watson, an instrumented PCSX2, records probes at a function's entry, fast captures, GS traces and GS memory reads, on both builds |
| Read | The function that computes the value is read in the HDD OSD disassembly, so the page records the rule that produces a number and not only the number |
| Verify | A script in `References/scripts/` (lab) recomputes the function's output from the probed inputs and compares it bit for bit |
| Mutate | `mutate.mjs` changes one constant, operator or comparison at a time; a verifier that still passes a mutant is not a test |
| Regress | `run_all.mjs` runs every verifier on every capture, build and video mode: 849 of 849 entries pass |
| Write | The result becomes a page in `facts/` (lab), which names its build, its script and its capture |

`References/model/clock_frame.mjs` (lab) assembles those verified functions into a model that produces every packet of
a clock frame. The native scene is ported from that model, and its tests compare it with state and passes
exported from real captures.

| Layer | Path | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Scene | `src/scene/` | Plain C++. The clock's state, camera, placement, rods, orbs, frame head and text, each part with the facts page it ports. Builds one `scene::Frame`; testable without a window |
| Render | `src/render/` | `Device` (instance, device, queues, VMA, swapchain) and `NativeRenderer`, which executes a `scene::Frame` |
| App | `src/app/` | The SDL3 window, real time, the frame loop and the ImGui debug panel |
| Assets | `src/assets/` | Plain C++, no Vulkan. The console's raw resource files decoded (ROMDIR, HDD container decrypt, Expand), the BIOS extractor and the `assets.bin` cache |

The measuring rule (`src/parity/`, `ParityTool`, the fixtures and the tests) is on the `lab` branch.

## Build

Requires Windows, Visual Studio 2026, CMake 4.2+ and the Vulkan SDK 1.4 with `glslc`.
SDL3, VulkanMemoryAllocator, vk-bootstrap, GLM and nlohmann/json are fetched on the first configure; Dear ImGui
is a submodule.

```powershell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/JeanxPereira/CrystalClockVK.git
cd CrystalClockVK
toolsuild.ps1 configure app
toolsuild.ps1 build app-release
```

`toolsuild.ps1` enters the Visual Studio developer shell and uses the Ninja that ships with it. The executables
land in `bin/`. The tests are not on this branch: they live on `lab`. `windows-vs` is the Visual Studio generator preset
for the IDE. CI builds the app on every push to `main`.

### Your own data

The console's raw resource files (`TEXIMAGE`, `FNTOSD`, `SNDIMAGE`, `ICOIMAGE`, `JISUCS`, `SKBIMAGE` and HDD OSD
1.10U's `hddosd.elf`) are in `resources/`, as the OSD loads them. They are Sony's. The build copies them to
`bin/resources`, and the app decodes them at each start (ROMDIR, the HDD OSD container decrypt, Expand, the 32-bit
conversion of `func_002344F8`; `src/assets/`).

```powershell
# Other files: a BIOS ROM image's TEXIMAGE, SNDIMAGE and ICOIMAGE are written, unchanged, to the resource folder
bin\CrystalClock.exe --bios <rom.bin>
# Or a folder with hddosd.elf, FNTOSD, TEXIMAGE (encrypted), ...
bin\CrystalClock.exe --resources <folder>
```

With no flag the app reads `resources` beside the executable. When files are missing it says which and exits.

The text needs `FNTOSD` and HDD OSD 1.10U's `hddosd.elf` (the original or the host copy; any other ELF is
recognised and not read): a BIOS gives the textures only, which is not enough to start: the meshes come from
the program. Loose files are used only when their flag is given (`--textures`, `--font`, `--program`, `--mesh`,
`--cube-mesh`). At start-up the app prints where the textures, the mesh and the text come from. The decryption tables and key
words are read from your `hddosd.elf`.

## Running

```powershell
bin\CrystalClock.exe
```

The clock starts as the console starts it: the initial values of `hddosd.elf`, the ported init functions of the clock thread
(`module_clock_init_resources` and its callees), the host's settings and local time, then frames at 59.94 Hz. It opens with the opening, hands off and starts the clock
thread after it; `--skip-boot` runs the clock module's own entry to the main menu instead (the menu takes input 129 frames
after the thread starts), and `--clock` opens System Configuration and hides the list with Square (the clock alone). Settings come from `%LOCALAPPDATA%/CrystalClockVK/settings.json` (`language`, `aspect`, `timeZone`,
`summerTime`, `dateFormat`, `timeFormat`); when it is absent the console's first-start defaults apply and the time zone is the host's.

| Flag | Does |
|---|---|
| `--soak N` | Runs an unattended scripted session for N seconds (resolutions, MSAA, resizes, minimise, pause and step, every target, a midnight crossing, screenshots) and reports frames and validation errors |
| `--smoke` | A 5.5 s resize and minimise run |
| `--no-validation` | Runs without the Vulkan validation layers |
| `--skip-boot` | Starts at the main menu without the opening (the panel also has Skip opening and Restart opening) |
| `--clock` | Starts at the clock alone instead of the main menu |
| `--pal`, `--language N`, `--aspect N` | Video mode and console settings for this run |
| `--settings <settings.json>` | Another host settings file |
| `--resources <dir>` | The folder of raw OSD resource files to decode |
| `--bios <rom.bin>` | Extracts the BIOS's resource files into the resource folder first |
| `--assets <assets.bin>` | Where the decoded cache is read and written |
| `--textures`, `--font`, `--program`, `--mesh`, `--cube-mesh`, `--shaders` | Loose files, used only when named |
| `--screenshots <dir>` | Where the panel's screenshot button writes; `out/screenshots` by default |

## Tests

The tests, the parity gates and `ParityTool` are on the `lab` branch (worktree `D:/CodingProjects/CrystalClockVK-wt/lab`).
It shares this tree's `CMakeLists.txt`: `tests/CMakeLists.txt` is hooked in when present and `-DCLOCK_BUILD_TESTS=ON`
(preset `tests`). A difference with no known cause is a failure, never a tolerance.

## Roadmap

| | |
|---|---|
| Clock screen: scene, native renderer, live window, text | Done |
| Menus: System Configuration and its glass cubes, Clock Adjustment, the transitions between them | In progress |
| Sound | In progress |
| The opening (boot intro, hand-off to the clock; `CrystalClock`) | Done |
| PAL, languages | Planned |
| Improvements beyond resolution and MSAA, each a switch over the faithful base | Planned |
| macOS | Planned |

What is verified and what is still open is kept, line by line, in `facts/README.md` and `facts/verification.md` on the `lab` branch.

## Documents

The facts pages, the verifiers, the design documents and the patent are on the `lab` branch: `facts/README.md` is the place to start.
