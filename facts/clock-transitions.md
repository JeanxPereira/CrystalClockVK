# Transitions of the clock scene: boot, main menu, System Configuration

Builds: **HDD OSD 1.10U** and **ROM 2.30**.
*Measured* = seen in a running build through a trace probe. *Verified* = recomputed from the
probed inputs and equal bit for bit (`References/scripts/verify_transitions.mjs`,
`verify_trail_fill.mjs`, and `verify_orbs.mjs`, `verify_approach.mjs`,
`verify_scale.mjs`, `verify_clock_state.mjs`, `verify_placement.mjs`, `verify_first_run.mjs`,
`verify_exits.mjs`, `verify_rand.mjs`, `verify_options.mjs`). *Read* = disassembly, or (section 4e
only) a reading of GS memory snapshots that no script recomputes.
Captures: `Watson/Runtime/captures/hddosd-110U-trans-*`, `rom-0230A-trans-*` and, for the flow
items, `*-flow-*` (`fr` in a capture name is the first run).
`node verify_transitions.mjs <trace> --timeline` prints the timeline of a capture.

The functions below differ between the builds only in data addresses (`diff_rom.mjs`:
`func_00234EA8` 0 words; `func_00234B88`, `func_00234C28`, `func_00234CD0`, `func_00234D18`,
`module_clock_234E70`, `module_clock_22F908`, `func_0022F078`, `func_0022F110`, `func_002320B0`
only address words). `StartSysConfig` has one more call and another sound number on ROM 2.30.

A ramp is four ints: length, value, changed, state (0 idle at 0, 1 rising, 2 held at the
length, 3 falling). One tick moves the value one unit.

## 1. What drives each stage, and who writes it

| Stage | Variable | Rule (who writes it) |
|---|---|---|
| Fade from black | mode, weight | Set-up calls set-mode(2): mode 2, weight 0, overlay colour black. Every frame `func_00234EA8` adds 1 to the weight; when it would pass 128 it stays 128 and the mode becomes 0. The overlay's alpha is `128 - weight` (*read*: `func_00234E08`). |
| Camera approach | offset | Set-up writes -100; every frame `offset = offset * 0.97`, added to the camera's z (`clock-camera.md`). It restarts on every start of the clock thread. |
| Scene scale | scale, target | `func_00232640`. HDD OSD: 0 while the time record is not filled (the first frame of every thread start), then `scale += (target - scale) * 0.03`. ROM 2.30: `* 0.1`, never zeroed. |
| Orbs fly in | orb position | `module_clock_22F908`, mode 2: every orb if the previous module is 1 (the opening), else orb 0 only (section 3). |
| Orb colours | orb colour | Mode 2: each orb's own colour blended to the base colour by the weight (section 3). |
| Orb sprites fade in | sprite ramp | Set-up (`func_00238F20`) sets the length to `fps * 256 / 60` and starts it rising. It ticks once per orb call, so 7 per frame: full after 37 frames. |
| Trails grow | the rings | Set-up (`func_00239E60`) empties the rings. One point per 3 frames; full (49 points drawn) after 149 frames. |
| Band (the vignette) | band ramp | Length `fps * 80 / 60`. `func_00234EA8` starts it rising when, in mode 2, the weight reaches `128 - length`. Set-mode(3) and `StartSysConfig` start it falling; closing System Configuration starts it rising. Ticked by `module_clock_234E70`; drawn only in mode 0 (*read*). |
| Main menu items | menu items ramp | Length `fps / 6`. `func_002320B0` starts it rising when, in mode 2, the weight is `128 - fps / 6`. The menu takes input only while it is held. |
| Rods | rods ramp, appearance | Length 1. `func_0022F078` (from `StartSysConfig`) starts it rising, `func_0022F110` falling. Appearance = value / length (`clock-state.md`), so it is 0 or 1; the rods are submitted only while rod 0's appearance is above 0.05 (*read*: `module_clock_22FE98`, constant `D_0036FBE4`). |
| Background grey | background ramp | Length `fps * 40 / 60`. Started rising by `StartSysConfig` (`func_002331C8`), falling by the closing schedule. |
| System Configuration | its ramp | Length `D_003702E0 + D_003702CC + D_003702D0` = `fps*40/60` (`func_00234B88`) + `fps*40/60` + `fps/6` (both `func_002324C8`) = 40 + 40 + 10 = 90 (*read* in `StartSysConfig`, set on every opening; equal to the length measured). `StartSysConfig` starts it rising; Back starts it falling; `func_00230FD8` hangs the closing schedule on its value. |
| Leaving the clock | mode 3, weight | The thread calls set-mode(3): weight 128, falling 1 per frame; at 0 the thread ends and writes 2 to the previous-module word. |

At 60 fields a second the lengths are 80, 10, 256, 40 and 90; at 50 they are 66, 8, 213, 33
and 74 (33 + 33 + 8). The 50 field lengths are *measured* on PAL runs (`verify_transitions.mjs`,
`verify_orbs.mjs`, section 5). The weight (128 steps), the camera factor and the scale factor do
not depend on the field rate.

## 2. Timelines (measured; values at the start of each frame)

### Entering the clock scene: every start of the clock thread

`T0` is the first frame the clock draws. The schedule after `T0` is the same in every entry
measured, on both builds:

| Frame | What happens |
|---|---|
| `T0` | mode 2, weight 0 (overlay opaque black); camera offset -100; rings empty; sprite ramp rising (7 after the first frame); 7 orbs drawn. HDD OSD: scale 1 on entry, set to 0 in this frame. |
| `T0 + 1` | weight 1, then +1 per frame; offset -97, then x 0.97 per frame; HDD OSD scale 0, then eased by 0.03 toward 1 (0.656 at `T0 + 36`, 0.979 at `T0 + 128`) |
| `T0 + 36` | sprite ramp at its length (256) |
| `T0 + 47` | the weight step reaches 48: the band ramp is started; it rises 80 frames |
| `T0 + 118` | weight 118: the main menu items ramp is started; it rises 10 frames |
| `T0 + 128` | weight 128; band ramp held at 80 |
| `T0 + 129` | mode 0; menu items ramp held: **the menu takes input from here** |
| `T0 + 149` | the rings are full: trails at their 49 points |
| `T0 + 378` | camera offset below 0.001 |

| Entry | Build | `T0` | Previous module | Orbs displaced |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| power-on, `SkipSearchLater` | HDD OSD | 162 | 2 | orb 0 |
| power-on, `SkipSearchLater BootOpening` (through the opening) | HDD OSD | 410 | 1 | all 7 |
| back from the Browser (circle to dismiss its HDD error, circle again) | HDD OSD | 2105, 99 frames after the second press | 3 | orb 0 |
| power-on (opening, then first run: see section 4) | ROM 2.30 | 453 | 1 | all 7 (first frame only) |
| back from the Browser (circle) | ROM 2.30 | 93 frames after the press | 3 | orb 0 |

**The only thing the previous-module word changes in the clock's start is which orbs fly in**
(and, *read*, that the screen code is forced to 100, the main menu). Camera offset, scale,
fade, band, menu items and trails follow the same schedule in all entries. The word is written
by `opening_transition_to_clock` (1), the clock thread's exit (2), `browser_exit_previous_module`
(3 *measured*) and `main` (*read*).

In the main menu: the orbs and their trails, the band, no rods (rods ramp idle, appearance 0),
background grey 0.

### Main menu to System Configuration (cross on the second item, held from frame `P`)

Same on both builds (HDD OSD `P` = 1645, ROM 2.30 `P` = 2034).

| Frame | What happens |
|---|---|
| `P + 2` | `StartSysConfig` runs: rods ramp, System Configuration ramp and background ramp start rising, band ramp starts falling |
| `P + 3` | rods at appearance 1 and submitted (packets per frame 364 -> 731); band 80 falling; background 1 |
| `P + 42` | background grey at 40 |
| `P + 83` | band at 0, idle |
| `P + 93` | System Configuration ramp held at 90 |

Mode stays 0, weight 128, scale 1, camera unchanged. The clock state through it: the rods'
colours and progress do not change with the opening; only the appearance goes 0 to 1 in one
frame.

### System Configuration back to the main menu (circle, held from frame `P`)

Same on both builds (HDD OSD `P` = 1904, ROM 2.30 `P` = 2311). Triangle is Options there: it
makes the same ramp fall but with the dialog ramp busy, and then none of the steps below run
(section 4a).

| Frame | Ramp value | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| `P + 3` | 90, falling | |
| `P + 12` | reaches 80 (`fps*40/60 * 2`) | band ramp starts rising (80 frames) |
| `P + 52` | reaches 40 | background ramp starts falling (40 frames) |
| `P + 91` | reaches 1 (`D_003702E8`) | rods ramp falls: appearance 0, rods no longer submitted from `P + 92` |
| `P + 93` | 0, idle | band held at 80, background 0 |

*Read* (`func_00230FD8`): each step is taken only while the dialog ramp is idle; ten frames
into the fall (`length - value == fps / 6`) `func_002303C8` is called (menu side, not read).

### Main menu to the Browser: leaving the clock (cross on the first item, held from frame `P`)

Same on both builds (HDD OSD `P` = 1622, ROM 2.30 `P` = 2010).

| Frame | What happens |
|---|---|
| `P + 3` | screen code 9999; menu items ramp falling (10 frames); after this frame the thread calls set-mode(3): weight 128, band ramp falling (80 frames) |
| `P + 4` | mode 3, weight 128, then -1 per frame: overlay alpha rises to black; orb 0 moves out and changes colour (section 3) |
| `P + 131` | last frame of the clock (weight reaches 0 in it); the thread ends, previous module := 2 |

The sprite ramp and the scale do not move while leaving.

## 3. The transition arithmetic (verified)

### Weight step, `func_00234EA8`, once per frame

```
mode 1 or 2:  weight += 1;  if weight > 128: weight = 128, mode = 0
mode 3:       weight -= 1;  if weight < 0: weight = 0            (mode stays 3)
mode 0, 4:    nothing
then, if the mode at entry was 2 (and was not just ended) and weight == 128 - band length:
              start the band ramp rising if it is idle
```

### Set mode, `func_00234C28(mode)`

Stores the mode; writes the screen size x 16 into the overlay record; then

| Mode | Weight | Overlay colour | Also | Callers |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0 | 255, 255, 255 | | none in either build: 6 callers each, all with the constant 2, 3 or 4 (*read*, scan of `jal`/`j` and of the address as a data word) |
| 2 | 0 | 0, 0, 0 | | scene set-up; end of the first-run intro (*read*) |
| 3 | 128 | 0, 0, 0 | band ramp starts falling if held | clock thread when leaving |
| 4 | 0 | 0, 0, 0 | | first-run intro (ROM 2.30 `0x00229840` *measured*) |

### One orb in modes 2 and 3, `module_clock_22F908`

`k` is the orb, `(x, y)` its projected position relative to the screen centre
(`clock-camera.md`), `W` the weight, `R_k` the orb's random number, `screen` the screen size in
pixels. The orb is displaced when the mode is 2 and the previous module is 1 (every orb), when
the mode is 2 and `k == 0`, or when the mode is 3 and `k == 0`:

```
a    = (int16)(W * 128)                 a quarter turn at W = 128
rest = 1 - sin(a)                       the table sine of clock-camera.md
dx   = (screen width  / 2) * cos(R_k) * rest
dy   = (screen height / 2) * sin(R_k) * rest

mode 2:  x += dx                 y += dy
mode 3:  x = x * (W / 128) + 1.5 * dx      y = y * (W / 128) + 1.5 * dy
```

every operation in single precision, cut toward zero, in that order; the depth is untouched.
So in mode 2 an orb starts on an ellipse of the screen's half size at its random angle and
arrives at its orbit as the weight reaches 128; in mode 3 orb 0 goes from its orbit to one and
a half times that ellipse while its own position shrinks to the centre.

`R_k = rand() % 65536` (C remainder), drawn for the 7 orbs at every start of the clock thread
(`func_0022EF40`, *read*). `rand` is newlib's: `state = state * 0x41C64E6D + 12345`,
`rand = state & 0x7FFFFFFF`, the state at `_impure_ptr + 0x58`. *Verified*
(`verify_rand.mjs`; captures `hddosd-110U-flow-rand-boot.log`, `hddosd-110U-flow-rand-opening.log`,
`rom-0230A-flow-rand-boot.log`): 21 of 21 angles equal (HDD OSD 14, ROM 2.30 7). On a plain HDD OSD
power-on the state is 1 when the clock draws them, so the angles are always
`7EA6 B0E7 E494 9B3D DF32 7483 B600`; after the opening (whose lights call `rand`) and on the
ROM 2.30 power-on (which plays the opening) the state differs.

Colour handed to the ring, four ints, with `base = (48, 98, 128, 60)` and the per-orb table
`(0,0,128,60) (0,128,0,60) (0,128,128,60) (128,0,0,60) (128,0,68,60) (128,68,0,60) (128,128,128,60)`:

```
mode 2, every orb:   (own[k][i] * (128 - W) + base[i] * W) >> 7
mode 3, orb 0:       (own[0][i] * (128 - W) + base[i] * W) >> 7
otherwise:           base
```

### What was compared, and how much

| Check | HDD OSD 1.10U | ROM 2.30 |
|---|---|---|
| weight step: mode, weight, band start | 1 884 frames; modes 0, 2, 3 natural, 1 and 4 written in | 1 509 frames; modes 0, 2, 3, 4 natural, 1 written in |
| band ramp tick | 1 884 | 1 509 |
| set mode: mode, weight, overlay colour | mode 2 twice, mode 3 once | mode 2 twice, mode 3 once, mode 4 twice |
| orb position, mode 2, every orb | 903 (boot through the opening) | 7 natural + 903 with mode 2 written in the menu |
| orb position, mode 2, orb 0 | 258 (plain boot, back from the Browser) | 129 (back from the Browser) |
| orb position, mode 3, orb 0 | 128 | 128 |
| orb colour blend, mode 2 / mode 3 | 2 709 / 896 | 1 813 / 896 |
| orb position and colour, no transition | all others, every one equal | all others, every one equal |
| trail with the ring filling (`verify_trail_fill.mjs`) | 6 244 strips, 148 176 points, heads 0..49 | 4 172 strips, 98 784 points |
| sprite fade rising (`verify_orbs.mjs`) | 761 orb calls, every sprite equal | 512 orb calls |
| camera approach from -100 (`verify_approach.mjs`) | 3 entries, 1 354 steps | 2 entries, 861 steps |
| scale across the entry (`verify_scale.mjs`) | 3 entries, zeroed then eased by 0.03 | first run: eased to 0.8 by 0.1; re-entry: stays 1 |
| clock state across open and close (`verify_clock_state.mjs`) | 116 + 116 frames | 117 + 117 frames |
| per-orb random angles (`verify_rand.mjs`) | 14 of 14 | 7 of 7 |
| options dialog ramp (`verify_options.mjs`) | 77 + 77 ticks, every value equal | 77 + 77 ticks, every value equal |
| exits for the drive's codes (`verify_exits.mjs`) | 11 codes | 12 codes |
| PAL transitions (`verify_transitions.mjs` with `CLOCK_VIDEO=pal`) | power-on, open, close: FOUND | open, close: FOUND |
| PAL trail fill (`verify_trail_fill.mjs`) | 2 086 strips, 49 392 points | not run |
| first run (`verify_first_run.mjs`, section 4) | 422 + 25 + 125 machine steps, 360 logo images; PAL 364 steps, 300 images | 335 + 666 + 665 machine steps, 805 logo images |
| PAL fade rising (`verify_orbs.mjs`) | 924 strips, 1 848 sprites | 924 strips, 1 848 sprites |

Every value compared is equal. `verify_orbs.mjs` prints PARTIAL on the entry captures only
because it looks for strips of two or more points and the first calls have none or one;
`verify_trail_fill.mjs` covers those (a filling ring gives `head - 1` points, down to an empty
strip).

Written in with the VM paused (stimulated, not natural): mode 1 on both builds (weight 0 to
128, then mode 0; orb colours stay the base colour), mode 4 on HDD OSD (25 frames), mode 2 in
the ROM 2.30 main menu (to get every-orb displacement over the whole weight range there).

## 4. The first-run path (ROM 2.30 from power-on, empty configuration)

*Measured*, capture `rom-0230A-trans-boot` (frames 443 to 949):

- `T0` = 453, previous module 1. The set-up sets mode 2 and the scale target is already 0.8;
  during the first frame set-mode(4) is called from `0x00229840`, and again at `T0 + 180`.
- Mode 4 for all 497 frames: weight stays 0, so the overlay stays opaque black over the scene.
  The orbs are still processed underneath: 7 per frame, rings fill, sprite ramp rises, camera
  approaches as in any entry.
- The scale eases from 1 to 0.8 by 0.1 per frame; no band, no menu items ramp.
- Only the 7 orb calls of frame 453 ran in mode 2 (every orb displaced, weight 0).

*Read* (HDD OSD; ROM 2.30 has the same six-stage machine at `0x00229778`, with an extra condition
on `0x001F00B0`): `main` calls `enable_enter_clock_module_208398` (writes 0 to
`should_enter_clock_module_2AD22C`) when `config_first()` reports no saved configuration or
`oobe_forced` is set; the clock's set-up `func_002324C8` then ends in `func_0022D760`: gate ramp
`D_002B46D0` shown, logo ramp `D_002B46F0` length fps, text ramp `D_002B46E0` length fps/2,
`D_002B4A34 = fps/2`, stage `D_00370264 = 0`, overlay `D_00370238 = 0x80`, scale target
`D_00370294 = D_0036FBC8 = 0.8`. Stages (table `0x00365710`): 0 PlayStation logo; 1 PS2 logo
(`oobe_load_image(res, x, y, w, h, alpha)`; each logo rises fps frames, holds fps, falls fps;
set-mode(4) when it starts); 2 the language prompt (text ramp; cross hides it; leaving it calls
set-mode(2)); 3 the User Preferences pages (page record `D_002B4A18`; overlay 0); 4 "Settings
completed" (cross); 5 the end (scale and target 1.0, gate hides, set-mode(2) unless an exit is
pending, the first-run flag switched off by `disable_enter_clock_module_208388`). The logo
rules are in `verify_first_run.mjs`.

Also *read* on HDD OSD (`scale-and-modes.md`): `func_0022D760` writes the 0.8 and `func_0022D828`
runs the intro states (two 180-frame cycles in mode 4, then the pages); its last state sets
scale and target to 1 and calls set-mode(2), which starts the normal fade. On a plain HDD OSD
power-on `config_first()` is false and the path is not taken; the HDD OSD captures below reach it
by writing 0 to `should_enter_clock_module_2AD22C` at the set-up breakpoint `0x002324C8` (state
`hddosd-1.10U-host-flow-firstrun.p2s`; stimulated, not natural).

### Compared traces (`verify_first_run.mjs`, `verify_transitions.mjs`)

*Verified*: every machine step and logo image equals the computed one. The logo image function is
`oobe_load_image` (HDD OSD `0x0022E5D8`) / `0x0022A600` (ROM 2.30); the verifier compares its
registers a0..a5 (resource, x, y, w, h, alpha) against the rows and the ramp it reads from memory.
`mutate.mjs verify_first_run.mjs`: 5 of 5 candidates killed, all by a wrong verdict (only 5
candidates exist).

| Capture | Build | Frames | Stages seen | Machine steps | Logo images |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `hddosd-110U-flow-fr-logos` | HDD OSD | 423 | 0, 1, 2 | 422 of 422 | 360 of 360 |
| `hddosd-110U-flow-fr-lang` | HDD OSD | 76 | 2, 3 | 25 of 25 | 0 |
| `hddosd-110U-flow-fr-end` | HDD OSD | 126 | 4 | 125 of 125 | 0 |
| `rom-0230A-flow-fr-logos` | ROM 2.30 | 336 | 1, 2 | 335 of 335 | 85 of 85 |
| `rom-0230A-flow-fr-cold` | ROM 2.30 | 667 | 0, 1, 2 | 666 of 666 | 360 of 360 |
| `rom-0230A-flow-fr-full` | ROM 2.30 | 1416 | 0 to 5 | 665 of 665 | 360 of 360 |
| `hddosd-110U-flow-pal-fr-logos` (`CLOCK_VIDEO=pal`) | HDD OSD | 365 | 0, 1, 2 | 364 of 364 | 300 of 300 |

Stage 3 (the settings pages) is not computed by the verifier: its next state is decided by the
page's own code, so on `rom-0230A-flow-fr-full` it is seen but not compared. On HDD OSD no
capture reaches stage 5.

`verify_transitions.mjs` on the same captures, every value equal:

- HDD OSD: `fr-logos` 423 of 423 weight ticks and band ramp ticks, 2 954 of 2 954 orb colours in
  mode 4; `fr-lang` 357 of 357 orb colours in mode 2 and 51 of 51 orb 0 positions in mode 2;
  `fr-end` 127 of 127 mode ticks and 127 of 127 orb 0 positions in mode 3.
- ROM 2.30: `fr-full` FOUND (190 of 190 orb 0 positions in mode 3). `fr-cold` carries no
  transitions probes (0 frames, PARTIAL): a coverage gap.
- HDD OSD PAL, `pal-fr-logos`: 365 of 365 mode, weight and band ramp ticks, 2 548 of 2 548 orb
  colours in mode 4. The ramp lengths are read from memory, so the 300 PAL logo images test that
  rows and alpha follow the probed ramp, not that the field rate is 50 independently.

In `run_all.manifest.json`: `verify_first_run.mjs` on the three HDD OSD and three ROM 2.30
captures above, `verify_transitions.mjs` on `hddosd-110U-flow-fr-{logos,lang}`.
`hddosd-110U-flow-pal-fr-logos` is not in it (Open).

## 4a. Options dialog of System Configuration (triangle)

*Verified* (`verify_options.mjs`; captures `hddosd-110U-flow-options-{open,close}`,
`rom-0230A-flow-options-{open,close}`). Triangle on a list entry pushes a dialog.

| | HDD OSD 1.10U | ROM 2.30 |
|---|---|---|
| push | `func_0022D558(page)` from `func_002316B8`; the page is chosen by the entry | `0x002288B8`; one fixed page |
| page title | the entry's name (for example "Clock Adjustment") | "Options" |
| dialog ramp | `D_002B46B8` | `0x00293BA8` |
| pages function ticking it, once a frame | `func_0022D5D8` | `0x00228918` |

The dialog ramp length is `D_003702D0 + D_003702CC` = 10 + 40 = 50 (PAL 8 + 33 = 41). The page
opens (`func_0022ABC8`) on the frame the rising value reaches `D_003702CC` (40); when the page's own
ramp falls, the dialog hides (`func_0022D5A0`). Compared on both builds: 77 + 77 ticks with every
ramp value equal (rising 5..50, falling 46..0), and the page opened on the computed frame.

`verify_frame.mjs` on the same captures: every packet the model produces is equal (HDD OSD 74 + 75
frames, 86.2% and 84.6% of the packets; ROM 2.30 75 + 75 frames, 92.6% and 90.0%; the rest is
text). With `--carry` the model's carried state differs in `entryActive` and in the
configuration-items ramp: the dialog is an event the model does not take yet (`clock-frame.md`).

## 4b. Exits of the clock thread for the drive's screen codes

*Verified* (`verify_exits.mjs`; logs `hddosd-110U-flow-exits.log`, `rom-0230A-flow-exits.log`).
With a code put in `s0` at the thread's decision (HDD OSD breakpoint `0x00225A4C`, ROM 2.30
`0x002210D4`), every code `0x6A..0x74` (HDD OSD) and `0x6A..0x75` (ROM 2.30) makes the thread
exit exactly 128 frames later at its end (HDD OSD `0x00225CD4`, ROM 2.30 `0x002213AC`), with the
writes the code selects. Code 9999 (the Browser) is section 2.

Code `0x72` is gated by the word at HDD OSD `0x1F0D58` / ROM 2.30 `0x1F0CF8`. *Read* (HDD OSD
`0x00225A78`..`0x00225A80`): the word is loaded and `blez` skips the code change when it is 0 or
less; above 0 the code is kept, and at `0x00225BCC`..`0x00225C94` it stores module 5 at `0x1F0648`
and 2 at `0x1F064C`, leaving `execute_app_type` (`0x1F0010`) at -1. *Measured* with `flow_exit72.mjs`
and `verify_exits.mjs` (logs `hddosd-110U-flow-exit72.log`, `rom-0230A-flow-exit72.log`,
`hddosd-110U-flow-exit72-gate0.log`, `rom-0230A-flow-exit72-gate0.log`): with the word written to 1
at the decision breakpoint and read back as 1, the thread exits after 128 frames at its end with
module 5, previous module 2, `execute_app_type` -1, equal to the rule `{module: 5}`, on both
builds; with it written to 0 there is no exit within 400 frames on both builds. The earlier logs
(`*-flow-exits.log`) never read the word, so they show only "no exit within 400 frames" for `0x72`.
These four logs are not in the regression suite (Open).

## 4c. PAL

*Verified* with `CLOCK_VIDEO=pal`, no copy of the verifier needed (`pal.md`):

- `verify_transitions.mjs`: FOUND on `hddosd-110U-flow-pal-boot` (power-on), `-pal-open`,
  `-pal-close`; and `rom-0230E-flow-pal-open`, `-pal-close`. The lengths are 66, 8, 213, 33, 74.
- `verify_trail_fill.mjs`: 2 086 strips, 49 392 points on `hddosd-110U-flow-pal-boot`.
- `verify_orbs.mjs`: 924 strips, 1 848 sprites on `hddosd-110U-flow-pal-fade-up2` (HDD OSD) and
  on `rom-0230E-flow-pal-fade-up3` (`CLOCK_BUILD=rom`, ramp rising 178 calls, shown 284 calls, 462
  of 462 sprites, 1 848 of 1 848 corners), ramp length 213.
- `verify_clock_state.mjs` (`CLOCK_BUILD=hdd`) and `verify_placement.mjs` on
  `hddosd-110U-flow-pal-hour-free`: 97 frames with every value equal (rod progress and
  appearance 1 164 of 1 164), and 679 of 679 orb matrices, positions, colours and rings. A
  `verify_orbs.mjs` and a `verify_placement.mjs` probe cannot share a capture (same function,
  different ranges).
- First run, HDD OSD PAL: section 4 (`hddosd-110U-flow-pal-fr-logos`, stages 0 to 2 only).

## 4d. ROM 2.30 PAL, record written

*Verified*: `rom-0230E-pal-clock-written` (state `rom-0230E-pal-clock`, PAL BIOS; `0x375200` written
at capture frame 0 to 900.0 ms, 59 s, 59 min, hour 5; 66 frames in exact mode):
`CLOCK_BUILD=rom CLOCK_VIDEO=pal node verify_clock_state.mjs` gives FOUND, 72 frames, every value
equal (rod progress and appearance 864 of 864). No script compares the hour carry in it (Open); the
capture is not in the regression suite.

## 4e. What each work buffer holds (read, no verifier)

These are *read* from GS memory (`watson_gs_read`), decoded by `extract_buffers.mjs`
(`flow_buffers_sends.mjs` for the per-send logs; PNGs and `send.log` in the git-ignored
`References/textures/buffers/{hddosd-110U,rom-0230A}-flow-sends-{clock,config}/`). No script
recomputes any of it, so none of it is *verified*.

Buffers: display 1 is the one drawn on the frames captured (display 0 on others), work 0 is
FBP `0xD2`, work 1 is FBP `0x118`.

At frame end (the GS memory at the start of a dump of `hddosd-110U-whole-clock`,
`hddosd-110U-whole-config`, `rom-0230A-whole-config`):

- Work 0 holds the scene as the refraction source: background, rods with +255, orbs in their
  second colours, alpha 127 mostly.
- Work 1 holds, on the clock screen, the second extra pass (reflection and grain on the rods' near
  faces, alpha 128/127); on System Configuration, the cubes' grey silhouettes.
- On System Configuration work 0's alpha is 128 exactly inside the cubes' silhouettes and 0
  elsewhere (the cubes' depth/alpha quads).
- The display buffers' alpha is 0 in the picture and 128 under the bars and the text.

Between sends: a breakpoint after the path sync that opens the DMA kick of the send function (HDD
OSD `0x00233468`, ROM 2.30 `0x0022F9A0`) stops the emulator, and the send sites are the `jal`s to
the send entry (HDD OSD `0x00238DB0`, ROM 2.30 `0x00235350`). The software renderer draws a batch
only when the next draw changes state, so the memory read at the stop before send *k* holds sends
up to *k-2*; a send's effect is the difference between the snapshots at the stops *k+1* and
*k+2*. Two exceptions: a rod's last send followed by an orb send shows one stop late (3 of the 12
rods of the first HDD OSD clock frame; its pixel count equals the fourth send's), and full-screen
sprites (clears, the alpha-30 rectangle) land at once. No stop needed more than 8 re-reads, and 0
re-reads were unsettled in all four logs. In ROM 2.30 the one-face-a-time grain sends of a split
rod have the same state and merge, so their effect shows only when the pass changes state; they
cannot be separated.

| Group | HDD OSD 1.10U | ROM 2.30 |
|---|---|---|
| Whole rod, clock | Five sends. s1: refracted far faces into work 1; s2, s3: grain into work 1 (about 0.9 and 0.8 of s1's pixels, alpha 127); s4: near faces into the display buffer; s5: the same pixels into work 0, brightened. First rod, pixels per send: 1515, 1358, 1185, 1515, 1515 | Same targets (work 1, work 1, work 1, display, work 0). First rod, from `send.log`: 1096, 915, 792, 1096, 1096 |
| Extra passes | `extra-rod.s2` reflection into work 1, `extra-rod.s3` grain over it; one rod in twelve uses `extra-rod.s1` in place of s2 (sends 67 and 91). An alpha-30 rectangle of 143 305 pixels (send 84, `[0,0,639,223]`) follows the first pass group and is absent after the second | Sends s2 (reflection) and s3 (grain); the s1 variant occurs once (send 93). The same rectangle appears as 8 575 pixels `[26,129,190,180]`, as a late entry |
| Cube, System Configuration | Eight sends. s1-s3 into work 1; s4 body into work 0 in grey silhouette colours (`rgb 83,87,118>24,24,26`); s5 sets alpha 32 with colour unchanged (alpha-only quad); s6-s8 into work 0 again. `cube-hl.s1` draws each silhouette into work 1 after a full clear to 0 (2 504 pixels in the first); `cube-hl.s2` sets alpha 128 on 225 of them (9.0%) | Six sends: s1-s3 into work 1, s4-s6 into work 0; no alpha-only quad send |

The first HDD OSD clock log holds 60 rod sends, then 48 extra-pass sends, then the rod sends of a
second frame, cut off at send 135. In it the first rod's fifth send reads `(nothing)` with a late
entry `work-0:1515`; the late entries are sends 5, 35 and 60 (1515, 1938, 1950, equal to the
fourth sends' counts). The rod targets are those of `clock-rod-draw.md`.

## 5. Build differences seen here

| | HDD OSD 1.10U | ROM 2.30 |
|---|---|---|
| Scale on entering the clock | set to 0 on the first frame, then eased by 0.03 | not zeroed; factor 0.1 |
| `StartSysConfig` | | one more call (`0x00223910`) and sound `0x5200` instead of `0x6300` (*read*) |
| Returning from the Browser | the Browser shows an HDD error dialog first; circle twice | circle once |

The transition arithmetic and all schedules are the same.

## 6. Open

- **The reset in `func_00234B88` (mode 0, weight 0)** is never seen: it is called once, at
  `0x00225DD8` in `module_clock_init_resources`, and set-mode(2) at `0x00225E60` in the same
  function; none of the seven functions called between them reads the mode or the weight
  (*read*). What it sets and is seen: `D_003702E0 = fps*40/60`, the band ramp length
  `D_002B5F20 = D_003702E4 = fps*80/60`, `D_003702E8 = 1`. Reason: nothing observable between the
  two calls.
- **Set-mode(1) (white overlay)** has no caller in either build; only the weight step of mode 1
  was exercised, by writing the mode in. Reason: unreachable.
- **First-run stage 5 on HDD OSD**: `hddosd-110U-flow-fr-end` shows stage 4 only, so the end stage
  (scale and target 1.0, gate hides, first run switched off) is *read* on HDD OSD, not compared
  (ROM 2.30 reaches it on `rom-0230A-flow-fr-full`). Script that would settle it: a longer
  `verify_first_run.mjs` capture of the HDD OSD state after the "Settings completed" cross.
- **First-run stage 3 (settings pages)** is not computed by `verify_first_run.mjs` (the page's
  own code decides the next state); on HDD OSD `fr-lang` compares 25 steps across the hand-off.
  Reason: the verifier has no rule for it.
- **PAL first run**: only stages 0 to 2 on HDD OSD (`hddosd-110U-flow-pal-fr-logos`); the PAL
  language prompt, pages and end stage, and any ROM 2.30 PAL first run, are not captured.
- **Regression suite**: `hddosd-110U-flow-pal-fr-logos`, `*-flow-exit72*.log` (four logs) and
  `rom-0230E-pal-clock-written` are not in `run_all.manifest.json`. The `verify_exits.mjs` entry
  lists only the two older logs, where `0x72` reads "gate word not read", so the suite does not run
  the gate-1 and gate-0 cases of section 4b (they pass when run by hand). Of six hand mutants of
  `verify_exits.mjs` reported, two were re-run and killed (`0x72` module, gate comparison);
  `mutate.mjs` finds no computing line in it.
- **PAL hour carry**: no script compares an hour carry. `rom-0230E-pal-clock-written` and
  `hddosd-110U-flow-pal-hour-free` are compared frame by frame (4c, 4d), but no script checks that
  they contain 5:59:59.900 to 6:00:00.005, or the record's later return to the RTC time. Only hour
  5 to 6 is claimed from the written capture; hour 23 to 0 is not exercised.
- **Buffers between sends (4e)** are readings, not verifiers: the renderer's deferred batching can
  move an effect to a later stop; ROM 2.30 split-rod grain faces cannot be separated per send; the
  orbs' own eight sends (HDD OSD `0x2391d0`, `0x239564`, `0x239844`, `0x239bc8` and the `0x2337b0`
  rectangles), the vignette and the blur sends are not analysed; PAL buffers are not read. A
  verifier would need a build that flushes the renderer's queue per draw.
- What the overlay, the band and the background ribbons draw, the clock-alone screen (ramp
  `D_002B5780`) and Clock Adjustment: other pages.
