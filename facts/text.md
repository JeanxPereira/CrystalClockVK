# Text: the font, a glyph, a string, and where the strings go

Builds: **HDD OSD 1.10U** (canon, build `hddosd-1.10U-host`) and
**ROM 2.30**. *Read* means read in `../CrystalOSD/asm/` (HDD OSD) or in the ROM's memory dump with
`disasm_rom.py`; *verified* means `References/scripts/verify_text.mjs` (or its extension `verify_text2.mjs`, `verify_text_frame.mjs`) recomputed it from the
inputs a trace probe recorded and it was equal, byte for byte, to what the console sent.
Addresses are HDD OSD's unless "ROM" is written.

**The two builds have different font code and the same glyph pictures.** HDD OSD uses Sony's
`libpfont` with one font file; ROM 2.30 has its own small routine with four pages of glyphs
loaded whole. The pictures of the 96 ASCII glyphs are the same pixels in both, bar one (95 of
96 equal), and both use the same sixteen-colour table; the widths and the spacing are not the
same (section 7).

## Result

| | HDD OSD 1.10U | ROM 2.30 |
|---|---|---|
| Glyph packets, byte for byte | 7 929 of 7 929 (624 bytes each) | 3 098 of 3 098 (96 bytes each) |
| Other packets of a string (opening state, texture set-up or page binding, pictures uploaded, colour table) | 1 636 openings, 1 216 texture set-ups, 11 pictures uploaded, 1 colour table: all equal | 810 openings, 522 page bindings: all equal |
| String level: every character asked for, with pen, colour and matrix | 41 575 of 41 575 characters, in 1 636 strings drawn and 3 542 measured; 175 distinct characters (first seven captures); `text2-close`: 22 963 of 22 963 | set, index, fixed width and pen: six NTSC captures equal (section 6) |
| Place level (date, time, menu items, hints, title and selected entry of System Configuration) | 312 of 312 strings (first five captures); `text2-close`: 1 186 of 1 186 | equal on six NTSC and five PAL captures (section 6) |
| Button pictures beside the hints | 157 of 157; `text2-close`: 88 of 88 | not compared (section 6) |
| Glyph pictures in GS memory against the font file | 242 loaded cells in 6 dumps, 327 426 pixels, all equal; colour table equal | four pages, 942 080 pixels, all equal to `FNTIMAGE` |

Captures (`Watson/Runtime/captures/`): `hddosd-110U-text-` `clock`, `menu`, `config` (the list of
System Configuration), `config-down` (the list moving one place), `adjust` (Clock Adjustment
entered), `version` (the version page), `boot` (power-on, from before the first string);
`rom-0230A-text-` `clock`, `menu`, `config`, `adjust`. 5 095 840 bytes of text packets compared
and equal on HDD OSD, 369 696 on ROM 2.30. `config-down` and `boot` were taken before the place
level's ranges were added to the probes, so the place level and the button pictures are from the
other five.

## 1. The font file of HDD OSD (*verified against GS memory and against every upload*)

`FNTOSD` (1 489 358 bytes on the disk, read through `host:`), expanded with the OSDSYS scheme to
2 958 240 bytes. `extract_font.mjs` walks it exactly as `scePFontGetGlyph` (`0x002905A0`) does
and writes `References/model/font-osd.json` (layout, ranges, metrics, colour table) and one PNG
per block in `References/textures/` (git-ignored: the pictures are Sony's).

```
+0x00  two zero words (scePFontAttachData 0x00292510 refuses anything else)
+0x10  "OSD font ver0.1"
+0x50  s16 ascent 33, +0x52 s16 descent -7, +0x54 s16 56 (the program's width of a blank, escape s)
+0x58  number of blocks: 6        +0x5C  their offsets
block:
+0x10  flags: low 3 bits pixel format (0 = 4 bits), bit 3 = one metrics record per glyph
+0x14, +0x18  floats: scale of x and of y (1, 1 in every block)
+0x1C, +0x1E  s16 width and height of a glyph picture
+0x20, +0x22  s16 ascent, descent      +0x28 glyphs
+0x2C  pictures: ((w x h x bits + 7) / 8 + 15) & ~15 bytes each, pixels low bits first, rows not padded
+0x30  ranges, +0x34 their offset: (first code, last code, first index entry, added to the entry)
+0x3C  index: one u16 per code of every range, 0xFFFF = no glyph
+0x44  metrics: seven s16 and a pad per glyph (one record for the whole block when bit 3 is clear)
+0x54  colour table: 16 colours of 32 bits
```

| Block | Glyphs | Picture | Codes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 529 | 32 x 40 | `0x20..0x45F` (Latin, Greek, Cyrillic), `0x20AC..0x2122`, `0x3000`, `0xD803..0xD818` (button and arrow marks) |
| 1 | 157 | 26 x 26 | `0x21..0x7E`, `0xFF61..0xFF9F` (never reached for ASCII: block 0 has those codes) |
| 2, 3 | 2 965, 3 390 | 26 x 26 | kanji, two sets |
| 4 | 635 | 26 x 26 | symbols, kana, full-width forms |
| 5 | 1 | 64 x 40 | `0xD81B` |

A code is looked for in the blocks in order: the block's ranges are searched by bisection, the
index entry gives the glyph (`added + entry`), the first block that has it wins. The program asks
for `0xD818` when a code has no glyph.

**Metrics** (seven s16): `originX`, `baseline` (where the pen is inside the picture),
`left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom` (the ink's box about the pen; top and bottom positive upward),
`advance`.

**Colour table** (the same in all six blocks), as R, G, B, A: index 0 clear; 1 to 4 black with
alpha 0x19, 0x32, 0x4B, 0x64; then grey `0x33` with alpha 0x32..0x7D, `0x66` with 0x4B..0x7D,
`0x99` with 0x64, 0x7D, `0xCC` and `0xFF` with 0x7D. The glyphs are a white core with a dark
outline; the outline is in the pictures, not drawn.

## 2. The glyph cache in GS memory (*verified*)

The program gives the library `0x4800` words at `0xBC100` and a colour table at `0xBC000`
(TBP0 `0x2F04`, CBP `0x2F00`). `_scePFontSetupTexCache` (`0x00290B10`) lays it out when a glyph of
a block is first uploaded:

```
cell width  = (picture width  + 2 + 7) & ~7       40 for block 0
cell height = (picture height + 2 + 3) & ~3       44
pages       = (0x4800 + 0x7FF) >> 11 = 9;  across = largest divisor of pages not above sqrt(pages) = 3
texture     = across x 128 by (pages / across) x 128 = 384 x 384, 4 bits, TW = TH = 9
cells       = (384 / 40) x (384 / 44) = 9 x 8 = 72, numbered row by row
```

and sends the block's colour table: `BITBLTBUF` to `0x2F00`, 8 x 2 pixels of 32 bits, the 64
bytes taken from the file by reference.

The cache has 99 entries (`(0x1000 - 0x3A0) / 0x20`) in a list, most recently used first; the
first 72 hold a cell. `_scePFont_Putc` (`0x00291858`) walks the list for the code and stops at
the code, at an entry never used, or at the end; the entry found moves to the head; if it holds
no cell it takes the cell of the last entry passed that held one (the least recently used) and
both are marked not loaded.

A glyph not loaded is uploaded by `_scePFontUpdateTex` (`0x00290EE8`): `BITBLTBUF`, `TRXPOS` =
the cell's corner, `TRXREG` = the whole cell, `TRXDIR`, then the cell's pixels and `TEXFLUSH`.
The picture sits **one pixel in from the left and the top**; the top row, the left column, the
rest of each row and the row under the picture are cleared. **The code does not write the last
two rows of a 44-row cell**: they go out as whatever the packet buffer held (40 bytes per
upload, the only bytes of the text packets not compared).

`_scePFontSetupTexEnv` (`0x002915C0`), once per string that draws: `TEX1_1 = 0x60` (bilinear
both when magnified and when reduced), `TEX0_1` = the cache, 4 bits, modulate, with alpha, its
colour table loaded.

*Verified:* the layout and the colour table at power-on (`boot`: 1 table, 10 pictures), one
more picture when the list moved (`config-down`); 440 bytes of unwritten rows left out. *GS memory:* at the start of every capture's dump each loaded
cell holds its glyph's picture one pixel in, with a clear top row and left column, and the
colour table is the block's.

## 3. One glyph: a fan of twelve vertices (*verified*)

`_scePFont_Putc`, with the metrics `(originX, baseline, left, right, top, bottom, advance)`:

```
x0 = left - 1    x1 = right + 1    yT = -(top + 1)    yB = -(bottom - 1)

vertex   position            what it is
0        (0, 0)              the pen, on the baseline: the fan's centre
1        (0, yT)             the pen's column at the top
2        (x0, yT)            top left
3        (x0, 0)             the baseline at the left
4        (x0, yB)            bottom left
5        (0, yB)             the pen's column at the bottom
6        (advance, yB)       the next pen's column at the bottom
7        (x1, yB)            bottom right
8        (x1, 0)             the baseline at the right
9        (x1, yT)            top right
10       (advance, yT)       the next pen's column at the top
11       = vertex 1
```

It is the ink's box with a pixel of margin, cut into a fan about the pen; the six extra points
are where the pen's column, the next pen's column and the baseline cross the box. The library
uses them: the pen's column (1, 5) to start the first glyph of a line exactly on the pen, the
next pen's column (6, 10) to find where the pen goes. With a matrix that only scales, as here,
the fan covers the same rectangle with the same texture mapping as one sprite would.

Texel of a vertex = its position with `(originX + cellX + 1, baseline + cellY + 1)` added (y
downward), then `S = s / 2^TW x Q`, `T = t / 2^TH x Q`.

```
M      = the font matrix, x column scaled by the block's x scale and y column by its y scale
M[3]  += pen                                          (the pen: x, y, 0, 0)
p      = M[0]·x + M[1]·y + M[2]·0 + M[3]·1            each product and sum cut toward zero
first glyph after the pen was set:  every p.x -= (p1.x - pen.x)        (the font matrix's own shift is taken back)
new pen.x = p6.x                                      (general form: where the line 6-10 crosses pen.y)
q      = screen matrix · p;  Q = 1 / q.w
XYZ2   = ((int)(q.x·Q·16), (int)(q.y·Q·16), (int)(q.z·Q))
RGBAQ  = (int)(colour × 128) for each of r, g, b, a;  Q
```

The screen matrix is the unit matrix moved by `(2048 - W/2, 2048 - H/2)`. The packet of a glyph
is 624 bytes: `CLAMP_1` = region clamp to the cell's picture plus its margin
(`MINU = cellX`, `MAXU = cellX + 1 + width`, `MINV = cellY`, `MAXV = cellY + 1 + height`), then
`PRIM 0x5D` (triangle fan, Gouraud, textured, blended, `ST`) and twelve times `ST`, `RGBAQ`,
`XYZ2`. A glyph needs 40 quadwords of the 511 the program's packet has; when they are not there
the character is given up, the packet is sent, and the character is asked for again.

## 4. A string (*verified*)

The program's own font state is at `0x003979B0` (the library's context, `0x1000` bytes, is at
`0x003969B0`):

| Offset | Set by | What |
|---|---|---|
| `+0x00` | `Font_SetRetHeight` | line height for a line break |
| `+0x04` | escape `p` | fixed width, 0 = proportional |
| `+0x08` | escape `r` | width in percent, 0 = 100 |
| `+0x0C` | `Font_SetPitch` | extra pitch |
| `+0x1C`, `+0x20` | | decoration flags; clip to the screen |
| `+0x24` | `Font_SetTvFontRatio` | half the ratio given: 0.5 (PAL: 1.15 / 2) |
| `+0x28` | `Font_SetRatio` | size |
| `+0x30` | `Font_SetLocate` | pen (ints made floats) |
| `+0x40` | `Font_SetColor` | r, g, b, a, each / 128 |
| `+0x110` | `updateTransMatrix` `0x00213380` | the font matrix |

```
x scale = size × (percent / 100 when percent is not 0)         func_002132B8
font matrix = diag(x scale, x scale × 0.5, 1, 1), moved by (pitch × x scale, 33 × 0.7 × 0.5 × size)
```

So a glyph is `x scale` wide and half that high (a field is half a frame), and the baseline is
`33 × 0.7 × 0.5 × size` under the pen's y: the pen is the top of the line.

`Font_PutsPackets` (`0x00213BA8`): matrix, pen and colour into the library, one packet opening
the string (`TEST_1 = 0x30000` depth test always, `ALPHA_1 = 0x44` `(Cs - Cd) × As + Cd`), the
string through `fontFilter` (`0x00212D78`), the packet sent; the pen and the colour are read back,
so they carry to the next string.

The filter reads UTF-8 and these controls:

| Bytes | Effect |
|---|---|
| `0x0A` | pen x back to the string's start, pen y + line height |
| `0x09` | pen x to the next multiple of 63 |
| `07 c N` | colour N of the table at `0x00348B20` (0 grey 96, 1 yellow 110 110 0, 2 blue 47 87 127, 3 pink, 4 dark 44, 5 teal, 6 red-brown, 7 grey 60, 8 grey 90, 9 green); alpha kept |
| `07 a NNN` | alpha = NNN / 255 |
| `07 p @ C` | fixed width = the advance of character C; `07 p N N` = NN; `07 p 0 0` = proportional again |
| `07 r N . N N` | width in percent (`r0.80`); `r0.00` = back to 100 |
| `07 y ± H H` | pen y = the string's start y + HH / 16 |
| `07 s` | pen x + 56 |
| `07 o NNN` | the mark `0xD800 + NNN` (018 = up and down arrows, 020 = the summer-time mark) |

With a fixed width a character is centred in it (`(width - advance) / 2`, toward zero, × x
scale) and the pen moves by `pitch × x scale + width × x scale`. The clock's hours and the
fields of Clock Adjustment use it with the width of `0`, so digits do not shift as they change.

`calcDrawArea` (`0x00213D38`) runs a string through the same filter with drawing off and the pen
at (0, 0), and returns how far the pen went; `func_00213EE8` gives the caller
`(int)((int)reach + pitch × x scale)`. Every string that is centred or right-aligned is measured
this way first, every frame.

*Verified:* all 41 575 characters of the seven captures: the code asked for, the pen (both
coordinates), the colour and the sixteen floats of the matrix, bit for bit, and whether it is the
first of its line. `boot` alone measures 2 085 strings (the program measures its whole string
table at start-up), with 175 distinct characters, so the filter was run over every English
string of the menu, including the escapes `c`, `p`, `r` and `o`. 119 characters were given up
for want of room in the packet and asked for again, as modelled.

*Read* (closed from the code, no capture needed): the escapes `s`, `a`, the decorations and
the clip. In the English table static strings use only `r`, `o`, `p` and, in the Browser's
CD-player labels only (not the clock module), `y`; `a` and `s` appear in no string; `c` appears
only through a Browser format string. The tables of other languages use `y` in clock strings
(section 5, languages). The decoration flag (`own+0x1C`, set only by `func_002129D8`) and the clip
(`own+0x20`, `func_00212808/18`) are written only by `func_00263070`, `func_0026AC40` and
`func_0026B458` (software keyboard and text entry, called from the Browser); the clock module
never sets them. No string drawn in any capture holds a line break. Not exercised: the
decorations' drawing (`func_00213448`, `func_002136F8`, `func_00213878`). Blocks 2 and 4 of the
font are exercised by the Japanese table (section 5, languages).

**The library context carried across frames** (*verified* by `verify_text_frame.mjs --carry`
with `References/model/clock_text.mjs`): the model carries the cache's most-recently-used list
(`_scePFont_Putc`, `0x00291894..0x00291978`), the cells, the block layout, the set-up flag and the
packet's room (`0x1FF` quadwords with a 4-quadword head, give up and continue) across
characters, strings and frames, reading the context once at a capture's first character. HDD OSD
captures `hddosd-110U-text2-` `menu` 770 of 770 packets, `boot` 3 599 of 3 599, `open` 10 552 of
10 552, `down` 4 710 of 4 710, `adjust` 1 386 of 1 386, `version` 1 488 of 1 488, `clock` 384 of
384; the carried list equals the library's at every string (99 to 4 799 checks per capture).
The strings' own font state is taken from each string's probe.

The capture `hddosd-110U-text2-close` (System Configuration back to the menu, 105 frames): 8 078
of 8 078 packets equal, 105 frames, 3 893 strings run through the model, carried cache list equal
to the library's 3 788 of 3 788 (*verified*, `verify_text_frame.mjs --carry`, `CLOCK_BUILD=hdd`;
registered in `run_all.manifest.json` for `verify_text_frame.mjs`, `verify_text.mjs` and
`verify_text2.mjs`).

**The model builds each string from the language table** (*verified* by `verify_text_frame.mjs --carry`
with `clock_text.mjs`, HDD OSD 1.10U): language = bits 4 to 8 of the word at `0x00371818` (1 when
0), table = `langtblptrs[language]` (`0x002AD200`), text = the ELF's bytes at the pointer that
`get_lang_string` (`0x002081B8`) returns (`D_002AD220 + 4 x id`). The language word is read once, at
the capture's first `Font_PutsPackets`. For each string the model resolves the pointer the caller
passed to an id of the active table (or to a fixed ELF address outside the table, such as the
clock template pieces at `0x00370178..`) and takes the text from the ELF; the text equals the
drawn string every time. `hddosd-110U-text2-fr-config`: 12 frames, 2 364 of 2 364 packets, 324
strings from the table equal of 324, 240 of 240 at fixed ELF addresses, 108 in RAM buffers filled
by the caller (date and time, taken from the probe; language word `0x07000020`).
`hddosd-110U-text2-jatable-boot` with `--table=0x00348c30`: 85 frames, 3 649 of 3 649 packets, 237
of 237 table strings, 255 RAM-buffer strings. A pointer found in another language's table and not
in the active one is a problem. Mutants run by hand on `fr-config` (`mutate.mjs` finds no computing
line in this verifier, the computing is in the model): language shift `>>> 4` to `>>> 5`, table
index `+ 1`, string end `+ 1` give PARTIAL; restricting `tablePointers` to one language and
changing the id value survive. The captures reach only the language words `0x07000010`
(English), `0x07000020` and `0x07000040`; the Japanese table is reached by `--table`, not through
the word. The model reads the word the way `config_get_osd_language` (`0x00203DD8`) does when the
video mode is not 0 and the field is 0 to 7 (read); the video-mode-0 path (returns whether the
field is 1) and fields of 8 or more (return 1) are not modelled.

## 5. Where the strings go (*verified for the callers below; NTSC*)

Positions are whole pixels of the 640 x 224 field. `width` is the measured width.

| Caller | String | x | y | Colour | Size |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `func_00226300` | date: `%04d/%02d/%02d` year, month, day for date format 0; `%02d/%02d/%04d` month, day, year for 1 and day, month, year for 2; dashes in fixed widths while the year is negative | 22 | 14; 32 when clock item 0 is 2 | 96, 96, 96 | 0.83 (`D_0036FB94`) |
| `func_00226300` | time: `"%s %s"` of (the summer-time mark `\ar0.88\ao020\ar0.00`, or nothing) and `\ap@0%2d\ap00:%02d:%02d` (12 h: hour mod 12, 12 for 0, then ` %s` = `\ar0.80\ap@AA\ap00M\ar0.00` or the same with P) | `W - width - 22` | same | same | 0.83 |
| `draw_clock_menu_items` `0x00232170` | menu item `n` | `430 - width / 2` | `H/2 - 14 + 16 n` | chosen 30, 110, 156 (`D_002B2540`); other 44, 44, 44 (`D_002B2550`) | 1 |
| `draw_button_panel` `0x00226770` | hint of slot 0..2 | slot's x for the language + 28 | 201 (183 when item 0 is 2) | 96, 96, 96 (`D_002B2460`) | 0.8 (`D_0036FB98`) |
| `draw_button_panel` | hint of slot 3 | `W - (width + 24)` | same | same | 0.8 |
| list of System Configuration `0x00231388` | title | `430 - width / 2` | 88 | 110, 110, 0 (`D_002B2570`) | 1 |
| `func_002311E8` | selected entry | `c - width / 2`, `c` = 430, or less by what `430 + width/2 + arrows + 16` exceeds `W - 24` | 112 | 30, 110, 156 | 1 |

Slots' x per language (`D_002B2470`, four per language; English is row 1): 24, 213, 335, 441.
The button picture of a slot is at the slot's x (slot 3: `W - (width + 24) - 28`), one line
above the text: `DrawIcon` (`0x00226508`) draws picture `D_002B24F0[slot]` = 2, 4, 5, 3 as a
sprite 25 wide and 12 high from texture 9 (`0x2EC0`), 32 x 32 texels each
(`D_002B22A0`: 0,0 / 32,0 / 0,32 / 32,32); pictures 0 and 1 are 28 wide from texture 8.

*Verified:* 312 strings in five captures (position, colour and size equal), and 157
button pictures (corners, texture corners and alpha equal). Not recomputed: 9 arrows, the
fields of the clock's value (0x2272C8.. 0x2273CC), the selected entry while it is edited
(0x2312D0), and the version page's lines (0x22A5C0.. 0x22A74C).

**Alpha** is not in the table: it is the product of the transition ramps. *Verified on HDD OSD
NTSC by `verify_text2.mjs` (`CLOCK_BUILD=hdd`), the alpha of `Font_SetColor`'s third argument and
the held float `a/128` both compared:*

| String | Writer of the alpha |
|---|---|
| date, time | `func_00230008`: 128 on the clock and in System Configuration, 0 in the main menu, where the text is sent and invisible |
| menu items | `func_00231E78` |
| list title | `func_00230E10` |
| list entries | `D_0037029C`, `D_003702A0` times the list's alpha (index, alpha, x, y and value y checked on every `func_002311E8` call) |
| button panels | `func_002269E0`: panel 7 alone, panel 8, panels 1 to 6 by `func_002326F0`, capped at 128 (id and alpha of every `draw_button_panel` call checked) |

Captures (`Watson/Runtime/captures/hddosd-110U-text2-`): `menu` (66 strings), `boot` (314;
alphas 11 to 128 rising), `open` (2 817; menu to System Configuration, every caller's alpha 0 to
128), `down` (643; the list crossfade: entries 16 to 128, values 48 to 128, clock value 8 to
80), `adjust` (308; editing colours), `version` (156, including the version page's places),
`clock` (36). In all seven the string, glyph, place, alpha, panels and entries are equal.

**Places of the remaining HDD OSD callers** (NTSC, *verified* by `verify_text2.mjs` in the
captures above):

- The list entry while edited (`0x2312D0`), the values (`0x231354`, centred on 430 at the value
  line, y 130), the arrow (`0x231624`).
- The clock value, drawn field by field by `clock_str_related` (`0x002270A8`): it starts at x
  minus half the cached template width `D_00370158` (the width of `"0000/00/00  00:00:00"`),
  each field is `\ap@0`, the digits, `\ap00`, then the separator (`/`, two blanks, `:`); the pen
  advances by `func_00213E90` = `(int)((int)(reach - start) + pitch x scale)`, and by two
  spaces' width after the date. While a field is edited it is drawn in the chosen colour and the
  others in 44, 44, 44.
- The arrows `\ao018` at the right of the selected entry: x = centre + (widest entry) / 2 + 16,
  y 112, colour 96, 96, 96, alpha as in the table.
- The version page: title centred on 404, labels right-aligned on 391, values at 417, rows from
  `rec[0x14] - 2` at `top - 17` stepping 11, colours by selection and row flag.
- *Read*: strings come from a table per language (`D_002AD220` points at it; id x 4):
  `get_lang_string` `0x002081B8`; ids 0x55 and 0x56 (Back, Enter) are swapped by the video
  mode. English: 0x55 Back, 0x56 Enter, 0x57 Options, 0x5E Display, 0x5F Version.

`hddosd-110U-text2-close` (HDD OSD, NTSC; *verified* by `verify_text2.mjs`, `CLOCK_BUILD=hdd`): 2 194
strings, 4 698 glyphs, alpha 2 194 of 2 194, place 1 186 of 1 186, button pictures 88 of 88,
panels 105 of 105, list entries 105 of 105, string level 22 963 of 22 963, 3 093 792 bytes
equal. The two checks that compare pictures uploaded to the cache and the colour table compare 0
items in it (the cache is warm).

**Languages, HDD OSD 1.10U NTSC.** The writers (*read*): `config_set_jpn_language` (`0x00203E58`)
writes `(v & 0x1F) << 4` into bits 4 to 8 of `var_mechacon_config_param_1` (`0x00371818`; mask
`0xFFFFFE0F`), conditionally (with the video mode 0 it writes when the old field is below 2, or
else when `v` is not 0; with the video mode not 0, when the old field is below 8, or else unless `v`
is 1). `config_set_langtbl` (`0x00208170`) calls it, then copies `langtblptrs[v]` (`0x002AD200`,
eight 4-byte pointers `0x348c30, 0x34c7f8, 0x34f288, 0x35dec0, 0x3550c0, 0x357e90, 0x352250,
0x35aec8`: Japanese, English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese) into
`D_002AD220`, which `get_lang_string` reads on every call. A write of the field alone changes
only the layout row (hint slots `D_002B2470` + language x 16), so the stimulus writes both words
after the code is loaded (`0x00371818` = `0x07000000 | lang << 4`, `0x002AD220` = the table
pointer); the language entry's own save path (`config_save_clock_osd`) was not driven.
`config_get_osd_language` (`0x00203DD8`, *read*): with video mode 0 it returns whether the
field is 1; with video mode not 0 and field 0 it writes 1 and returns it, and a field of 8 or more
returns 1.

*Verified* (`verify_text2.mjs`, `CLOCK_BUILD=hdd`; every packet, pen, place, alpha, panel and entry
equal), captures `hddosd-110U-text2-`:

| Capture | Strings | Glyphs |
|---|---|---|
| `fr-menu` | 72 | 792 |
| `fr-config` | 408 | 1 692 |
| `fr-boot` | 326 | 3 349 |
| `de-menu` | 72 | 816 |
| `de-config` | 374 | 1 320 |
| `de-boot` | 342 | 3 703 |
| `es-config` | 374 | 1 408 |
| `pt-config` | 374 | 1 452 |
| `it-config` | 374 | 1 606 |
| `nl-config` | 442 | 1 625 |

The language word probed is `0x07000020` (French), `0x07000040` (German). Strings are UTF-8 and
the accented letters are in block 0 of `FNTOSD`. Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and Dutch were
captured in the System Configuration state only, French and German also at the menu and at boot.
The French and German `boot` captures upload accented glyphs to the cache inside the trace. The Italian and Dutch tables hold the `y` escape
in the static clock string id `0x5E` (Italian: `07 r0.94 07 y+08 "Visualizzazione" 07 y+00 07
r0.00`; Dutch: the same with "Weergeven"), so `y` and `r` are verified in `it-config` and `nl-config`; id `0x54` also carries a
`y` escape in the French, Italian, Dutch and other tables (read from the ELF).

Japanese. On a non-Japanese console the field is never 0 (forced to 1), so the layout row stays
English. Writing the Japanese table pointer alone (`0x002AD220` = `0x00348C30`) on the E BIOS
(`hddosd-110U-text2-jatable-boot`, boot, advance 230) draws Japanese strings through blocks 2
(kanji) and 4 (kana) of `FNTOSD`, 26 x 26, 4 bits: 308 strings, 2 149 glyphs, string, place and
alpha equal, FOUND (*verified*). The 13 680 picture bytes the code leaves unwritten for these
glyphs are not compared. `text_blocks.mjs` over the eight tables (*read* from the tables, not
captured): table 0 uses blocks 0, 2 and 4, tables 1 to 7 block 0 only; blocks 1, 3 and 5 are
reached by no clock string. The capture `hddosd-110U-text2-ja-boot` on the Japanese BIOS
`ps2-0210j-20040917.bin` holds 0 packets (verifier verdict PARTIAL): HDD OSD does not reach text
there (the cause is under Open).

**PAL, HDD OSD** (`verify_text2.mjs`, `CLOCK_BUILD=hdd CLOCK_VIDEO=pal`, captures
`hddosd-110U-text2-pal-` `menu`, `clock`, `version`, `config`, `adjust`, `down`): FOUND on all six
(72 strings 696 glyphs, 33 and 286, 156 and 1 176, 408 and 1 356, 308 and 902, 643 and 3 544);
`verify_text_frame.mjs --carry` FOUND on the six (12, 11, 12, 12, 11, 46 frames) (*verified*).
`DrawIcon` (`0x00226618..0x00226684`, *read* in `DrawIcon.s`): `is_pal_vmode` = 1 runs the body,
NTSC skips it. It replaces the picture's bottom `b` (field `+0x24`, sixteenths) by `bottom =
trunc(top + (float)(b - top) x 0.5405d / 0.47d)` (`litodp`, `fptodp`, `dpmul` by the double at
`0x365580`, `dpdiv` by the double at `0x365588`, `dpadd`, `dptoli`), `top` = `+0x14`. The verifier
reads the constants from the ELF (`0x3FE14BC6A7333333` and `0x3FDE147AE0000000`). Pictures equal:
menu 24 of 24, clock 11 of 11, version 48 of 48, config 84 of 84, adjust 22 of 22, down 138 of 138.
Mutants on `pal-down`: `trunc` to `round`, `+1` on the top, multiply and divide swapped, the sign
flipped, each 0 of 138 (killed); removing `Math.fround` leaves 138 of 138 (the operand is an
integer count of sixteenths). The low mantissa bit of each constant is not distinguishable (the
results 220.8 and 257.6 of a sixteenth are far from an integer). The soft-double routines `dpmul`,
`dpdiv`, `dpadd` are modelled as IEEE round-to-nearest; their rounding code was not traced bit by
bit. The ratio 1.15 of the TV and the scaling `0.5405 / 0.47` of positions are checked only by the
captures' equality.

## 6. ROM 2.30 (*verified at glyph, string, place and alpha level*)

Its own code, about a tenth of the size. Four pages are in GS memory from start-up, from the
ROM file `FNTIMAGE` (a directory of files expanded on load):

| Page | File | Size | Cells across | Where | Table of (left, width) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `FNTASCII` | 256 x 480 | 8 | `0x2F05` | pointer at `0x002800CC` (`0x0027E6B0`), 97 glyphs from `0x20` |
| 1 | `FNTEX000` | 512 x 760 | 16 | `0x3005` | `0x0027ECB0`, 304 |
| 2 | `FNTEX001` | 512 x 760 | 16 | `0x3405` | `0x0027F630`, 304 |
| 3 | `FNTEXOSD` | 512 x 80 | 16 | `0x3805` | `0x0027FFB0`, the marks |

Cells are 32 x 40; colour tables at `0x2F00..0x2F03`, all four the HDD OSD file's sixteen
colours. `extract_font.mjs --rom` writes `References/model/font-rom.json` and the pages as PNG.

The character function `0x0020ACA8(set, bound, index)` sends one sprite:

```
cell = index (minus 0x20 for set 0);  column = cell % across;  row = cell / across
x0 = pen.x + (2048 - W/2) × 16   [+ (int)(sx × (fixed - width) × times × 0.5 × 16) with a fixed width]
y0 = pen.y + (2048 - H/2) × 16 + (int)(sy × lead) + drop + lower
x1 = x0 + (int)(sx × width × times) × 16          y1 = y0 + height
U0 = (column × 32 + left) × 16 + 8                 U1 = (column × 32 + left + width) × 16 - 8
V0 = row × 40 × 16 + 8                             V1 = row × 40 × 16 + 0x278
PRIM 0x156 (sprite, textured, blended, UV); RGBAQ = the colour's four ints; UV, XYZ, UV, XYZ, z = 1
advance = (int)(sx × pitch) + (int)(sx × (fixed or width) × times)
```

Pen in sixteenths at `0x002803A8`, `0x002803AC`; `sx`, `sy` at `0x00300EC4`, `0x00300EC8`;
`height` at `0x00300ED0`; colour at `0x00300EA0`; fixed width `0x002800B0`, `lower`
`0x002800B8`, `times` `0x002800BC`. The page is bound (`TEX0_1`, `CLAMP_1 = 5`, `TEX1_1 = 0x61`)
once per string for set 0 and before every glyph of the other sets. A string opens with
`TEST_1 = 0x3000D` (depth test always, and pixels of alpha 0 dropped) and `ALPHA_1 =
0x80_00000044`: the same blend `(Cs - Cd) × As + Cd`, with a FIX of 0x80 that this blend does
not use. The string function `0x0020C6F8` reads Shift-JIS, not UTF-8, and its control function
`0x0020C380` takes the same escapes (`c`, `a`, `p`, `r`, `y`, `s`, `o`, tab, line break); it
moves the pen by `advance × 16` after each character.

*Verified:* 3 098 sprites, 522 page bindings and 810 openings in four captures, every byte
equal; the pen of 2 576 characters equal to the pen before plus the advance computed; the four
pages in GS memory equal to `FNTIMAGE` expanded (942 080 pixels) in every dump.

*Verified, string, place and alpha level* (`verifyRom2` in `verify_text2.mjs`, probes `ROM_PROBES`,
`CLOCK_BUILD=rom`, captures `rom-0230A-text2-`; the six verdicts are FOUND, "every byte,
character, width, place and alpha equal"): opening, page binding, glyph, string level (set,
index, fixed width, pen), colour block, measured width, place, alpha and panels.

| Capture | Strings | Glyphs |
|---|---|---|
| `config` | 372 | 1 164 |
| `clock` | 36 | 312 |
| `open` | 1 812 | 4 792 |
| `menu` | 72 | 696 |
| `adjust` | 336 | 984 |
| `down` (list crossfade) | 643 | 3 544 |

Rules per caller (ROM addresses: menu `0x0022E3E0`, hints `0x00221E48`, list `0x0022D728`, clock
value `0x00222830`; ramps `0x0028B00C`, `0x0028B070`, `0x0028B110`, `0x00293BA8`, `0x002953F0`,
`0x00296740`; gp `0x002CFEF0`) are written in `verify_text2.mjs` (`romPlace`) and pass on those
captures. The colour block equals the setters in every string: the context is seeded from the
`Font_SetColor` and `Font_SetRatio` probes that precede the capture's first string, so the string
drawn before the first `Font_SetColor` of the capture is covered. List entries' alpha: entry
alpha at `0x00296B90 + 0x30 i + 0x24` times the list's; entry strings drawn where it is 16 or
more, values where it is not 0, the clock value's alpha is entry 0's.

*Read, differing from HDD OSD*: ROM panels drop an alpha under 128 where HDD caps at 128; ROM
panel 8 returns without panels 1 to 6; the menu line is 18 in PAL and the top `H/2 - 17.25` in
PAL (HDD 16 and 14); the hint y has no +1; ROM measures the clock template every frame (HDD
caches it) and advances the fields by their measured width.

*Width and the trimming branch.* The measure model `romWidth` computes widths in all six captures
and throws if the last code of a string is a double-byte code (code 0x8141 or above) while
`settings+0x14` is not 0. The branch it guards is the trimming branch of `0x0020CBA0` at `0x0020CE44`;
its body (width minus `2 s0 / 3` or `2 s0 / 5`) is not modelled and `romWalk` rejects bytes of
0x81 and above. The codes of the strings drawn in the captures (ASCII, escape results at most 999,
or `0x16`, `0x18`, `0x19`) are below 0x8141, so the guard does not fire. Which languages reach the
branch and what `settings+0x14` and `0x00205830` hold are under Open.

*Mutation* (`mutate.mjs verify_text2.mjs --capture rom-0230A-text2-down`): 30 of 150 mutants
killed in a full run; `--limit 20` kills 3 of 20. The survivors are in code the ROM capture
does not run (HDD-only code, PAL constants) and the throw guard of `romWidth` and the colour
seeding, which the mutator skips.

**ROM 2.30, PAL** (E BIOS, `verify_text2.mjs`, `CLOCK_BUILD=rom CLOCK_VIDEO=pal`, captures
`rom-0230E-text2-pal-` `menu`, `config`, `clock`, `adjust`, `down`): FOUND on all five (72 strings
696 glyphs; 372 and 1 164; 33 and 286; 336 and 984; 643 and 3 544): opening, binding, glyph, string
level, colour, width, place, alpha and panels equal (*verified*). The ROM's button pictures are
not compared, only the panels' id and alpha.

## 7. Where the builds differ (*measured on both*)

| | HDD OSD 1.10U | ROM 2.30 |
|---|---|---|
| Font code | `libpfont`, file `FNTOSD`, glyphs by Unicode | own code, `FNTIMAGE`, glyphs by page and index, Shift-JIS |
| Glyphs in GS memory | a cache of 72 cells of 40 x 44 at `0x2F04`, filled as characters are first drawn | four whole pages at `0x2F05`, `0x3005`, `0x3405`, `0x3805` |
| A glyph | fan of 12 vertices, `ST`, the ink's box plus a pixel | sprite, `UV`, the cell from `left` to `left + width` |
| Width of a glyph | the pen moves by `advance × x scale` | the pen moves by `(int)(sx × width) + (int)(sx × -3)`; the table's `width` is HDD's `advance` + 4 and its `left` HDD's `originX` - 2 for 94 of the 96 ASCII glyphs (not the blank, 13 against 6, nor `~`): one pixel more per glyph at size 1 |
| Blend | `(Cs - Cd) × As + Cd`; `TEST_1 0x30000` | the same blend; `TEST_1 0x3000D`: pixels of alpha 0 are dropped as well |
| Sampling | `TEX1 0x60`, region clamp to the glyph's cell | `TEX1 0x61` (the same filter, level of detail fixed), clamp to the page |
| Hours | `%2d` in a fixed width | the same |
| Pictures | the same 4-bit pictures and colour table: 95 of the 96 ASCII glyphs equal pixel for pixel; `~` differs in 209 pixels | |

## 8. Open

- ROM 2.30 trimming branch (`0x0020CBA0`, `0x0020CE44`): reported, not reproduced, that
  `settings+0x14` is 1 in every ROM capture, that `0x00205830` returns 1 (probe block
  `0x0027B388`), and that language 0 trims only on last codes `0x8141`/`0x8142`, language 3 on
  `0xA3BF`/`0xA1A3`/`0xA1A2`, language 6 on `0xF240`/`0xF3F8`/`0xF3F9`. Reason: there is no ROM
  disassembly of those addresses on disk and the HDD asm has no equivalent, and the docstring of
  `romWidth` says "No trimming". The six captures' widths are equal either way. Settled by
  `disasm_rom.py` over `0x0020CBA0..0x0020CE60` and `0x00205830`, or by a ROM capture in a
  language that returns 0, 3 or 6 (not taken).
- ROM 2.30 PAL constants in `romPlace` (menu line 18, top 17.25, list top `0x65`): the five
  `rom-0230E-text2-pal-` captures pass, but mutants of them were not run on those captures (the
  `rom-0230A-text2-down` run cannot reach them). Settled by `mutate.mjs verify_text2.mjs --capture
  rom-0230E-text2-pal-down`.
- ROM 2.30 button pictures (position, NTSC and PAL): not compared by any verifier; the ROM's
  draw path for the picture is unread.
- ROM 2.30 pages' load at start-up: GS memory holds them equal to the file; the upload was not
  traced.
- HDD OSD on the Japanese BIOS `ps2-0210j-20040917.bin`: the capture `hddosd-110U-text2-ja-boot` is
  empty. A hang of the EE kernel at `0x8000E160..0x8000E174` (a loop polling halfword
  `0x1A000006` bit 1, which reads 0 in the emulator) with no EE thread, and 16 IOP modules
  loaded, is reported; the same with a `nop` over the `beqz` at `0x8000E174` giving 24 modules and an
  idle kernel at `0x800110AC`. Reason: reported by one run, not reproduced (needs Watson and the
  J BIOS). Settled by `text_jprobe.mjs` on that BIOS. Until then a Japanese console's layout row 0
  (hint slots) is not verified: `jatable-boot` runs the English layout row with Japanese strings.
- Font blocks 1, 3 and 5: no clock string of the eight tables reaches them, so no capture can;
  `JISUCS` (`References/dumps/hddosd-host/JISUCS`) was not examined. Decorations' drawing and a
  line break: no captured string uses them.
- Languages: the video-mode-0 path of `config_get_osd_language` and field values of 8 or more are
  not modelled in `clock_text.mjs`; the language entry's own save path is not driven; Spanish,
  Portuguese, Italian and Dutch have no menu or boot capture (accented uploads inside a trace
  are verified for French and German only).
- `clock_text.mjs` takes the date and time strings from the probe: the buffers at `0x00397B30`,
  `0x00400750`, `0x00400870` are filled by `sprintf` from the console's RTC, not probed as state
  (108 of 672 strings in `fr-config`). It does not derive the caller's string id from the caller's
  rules. ROM 2.30 has no frame model of text (different string path).
- Soft-double rounding (`dpmul`, `dpdiv`, `dpadd`) in `DrawIcon`'s PAL branch and the last
  mantissa bit of its two constants: not distinguishable by any capture.
- The Browser's text (outside the clock module).

## 9. Files

- `References/scripts/verify_text.mjs` (`CLOCK_BUILD=hdd|rom`, exports `PROBES`; reads
  `References/dumps/hddosd-host/FNTOSD` or the BIOS file for the pictures, and the capture's
  `.gs` beside the trace for the GS memory check).
- `References/scripts/verify_text2.mjs` (extends `verify_text.mjs`: alpha, remaining places, ROM string level, PAL),
  `References/scripts/verify_text_frame.mjs` (`--carry`), `References/model/clock_text.mjs`.
- `References/scripts/text_capture.mjs` (capture with `CLOCK_BIOS`), `text_jprobe.mjs` (where the
  EE is), `text_lang_word.mjs` (the language word of a capture), `text_blocks.mjs` (the font block
  of each character of the language tables).
- `References/scripts/extract_font.mjs` (HDD OSD's file; `--rom` for the ROM's pages).
- `References/model/font-osd.json`, `References/model/font-rom.json`.
- `References/textures/font-osd-block*.png`, `font-rom-*.png` (git-ignored).
