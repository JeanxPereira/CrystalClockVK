# What has been verified, on which build

Every row is a script in `References/scripts/` that recomputes what a function produced from the
inputs a trace probe recorded at its entry, and compares bit for bit. `CLOCK_BUILD=hdd` selects
HDD OSD 1.10U's addresses (`builds.mjs`); the default is ROM 2.30; `CLOCK_VIDEO=pal` selects
PAL (`pal.md`). Captures are in `Watson/Runtime/captures/`, named `hddosd-110U-…` and
`rom-0230A-…` (`rom-0230E-…` in PAL).

**HDD OSD 1.10U is the canon build, and it runs** (`hddosd-boot.md`).

**Re-running all of it.** `References/scripts/run_all.manifest.json` has 849 entries, one per
verifier, capture, build and video mode, and `node References/scripts/run_all.mjs` passes 849 of 849 (2026-10-03); `node References/scripts/run_all.mjs` runs them in
parallel and exits 1 on any that no longer passes (`--filter <regex>`, `--changed`, `--jobs <n>`).
`node References/scripts/mutate.mjs <verifier>` changes one constant, operator or comparison of
a verifier at a time and expects none of the mutants to end `FOUND`.

ends `FOUND`, and their coverage is in `clock-frame.md`.

## Text (`text.md`)

| Script | What it recomputes | HDD OSD 1.10U | ROM 2.30 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `verify_text.mjs` | every glyph packet, string openings, texture set-ups and uploads; on HDD OSD also character, pen, colour and place of every string | 7 captures: 7 929 glyph packets, 41 575 string-level values, 312 places | 4 captures: 3 098 glyph packets, 2 576 pen steps |
| `verify_text2.mjs` | alpha of every caller, the remaining places, the languages, PAL; on ROM 2.30 string, place and alpha level | 18 captures `hddosd-110U-text2-*` (NTSC, incl. `close`, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, the Japanese table), 6 PAL (`pal-menu`, `-clock`, `-version`, `-config`, `-adjust`, `-down`: `DrawIcon` pictures equal): string, glyph, place, alpha, panels and entries equal | 6 captures `rom-0230A-text2-*` (`config`, `clock`, `open`, `menu`, `adjust`, `down`) and 5 PAL `rom-0230E-text2-pal-*`: opening, binding, glyph, string level, colour, width, place, alpha, panels equal; the ROM's button pictures are not compared (`text.md` section 6) |

## The opening intro (`opening.md`)

The intro's verifiers run on ROM 2.30 through `extract_opening_rom_trace.mjs` (`opening.md`
section 6); the `_v2` copies (`verify_opening_{camera,camera_rom,cubes,fog,lights,towers,vu1}_v2.mjs`
and `verify_opening_overlays_v2.mjs`) route single-precision operations through the exact helpers
of `References/model/opening-lib.mjs` and give the same counts as the plain versions on every
capture of the page.

| Script | What it recomputes | HDD OSD 1.10U | ROM 2.30 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `verify_opening_camera.mjs`, `verify_opening_camera_rom.mjs` | camera integrator, fade, blur level, logo alpha | 247 frames, the whole intro | 359 frames (the ROM's own update function) |

| `verify_opening_fog.mjs` | six fog layers | 246 frames, 25 092 packets | 347 frames, 35 394 packets; 358 frames on the whole intro |
| `verify_opening_overlays.mjs` | the ghost of the previous frame, the logo | 246 + 120 draws | logo 120 (the ghost half models HDD OSD's call sequence and does not apply) |
| `verify_opening_ghost.mjs` | the ghost | on the illegal-disc scene: 238 ghosts | 358 |
| `verify_opening_towers.mjs`, `verify_opening_vu1.mjs` | the towers' PATH1 packets from a model of the VU1 microprogram | up to 3 780 towers; both routines and the out-of-bounds path exercised (the moved-coordinates routine only with the code patched: no history reaches it) | 1 512 towers in 12 frames; 19 278 towers on `rom-0230A-opening3-towers-late-as-hdd` (`verify_opening_vu1_v2.mjs`) |
| `verify_opening_towers_ee.mjs` | the towers' VIF1 chain from the play history | 6 300 chains | 1 512 chains; 19 278 on `rom-0230A-opening3-towers-late-as-hdd` |
| `verify_opening_flat.mjs` | frame copy, bars, fade, dive blur | 557 calls | 784 calls: copy 359, bars 359, fade 31, blur 35 |

| `verify_opening_handoff.mjs`, `verify_opening_handoff_rom.mjs` | the hand-off to the clock or the illegal-disc scene | HDD OSD | 1 hand-off |
| `verify_opening_illegal.mjs`, `verify_opening_illegal_cubes.mjs` | the illegal-disc scene: values of the draw, its cubes | 239 frames, 1 768 948 writes equal; 1 190 cubes, 464 100 writes equal | through `verify_opening3_illegal_v2.mjs` below |
| `verify_opening3_stages.mjs`, `verify_opening3_stages_rom.mjs` | the stage machine under stimulated disc states, hard-disk words and the illegal scene's end wait; sound commands in command, argument registers and call site | 33 captures `hddosd-110U-opening3-*`; `-illegal` 242 frames; PAL `-pal-intro`, `-pal-illegal` (224 frames) | 42 captures `rom-0230A-opening3-*` (`-intro` 359 frames); 8 PAL `rom-0230E-opening3-pal-*` (`-intro` 291 frames) |

## PAL (`pal.md`)

Both builds were run in PAL for real (BIOS 2.30 E; `CLOCK_VIDEO=pal`). Every verifier of the
first table passes there on both builds except `verify_trail_fill.mjs` and `verify_first_run.mjs`,
which are not run on ROM 2.30 PAL (the sprites' fade rising is: `rom-0230E-flow-pal-fade-up3`).
On HDD OSD every opening verifier passes in PAL (`opening.md` section 7: stage machine 206
frames, flat draws 465, ghost 205, cubes 822, fog 205, lights 182, library inputs 70 436 values,
hand-off 1, logo 120; the illegal-disc scene `hddosd-110U-opening3-pal-illegal`; the towers on
`hddosd-110U-opening3-pal-towers-a` and `-late`). On ROM 2.30 PAL: the intro, stage machine and
hand-off (`rom-0230E-opening3-pal-*`, 291 frames), the illegal-disc scene
(`rom-0230E-opening3-pal-ill-a-as-hdd`), the towers (`rom-0230E-opening3-pal-towers-a-as-hdd`,
`-late-as-hdd`), the record written to hh:59:59 (`verify_clock_state.mjs` on
`rom-0230E-pal-clock-written`, 72 frames) and the text (`verify_text2.mjs`, 5 captures). No
script compares the hour carry in PAL (`pal.md` section 6).

## Where the builds differ, all measured on both

| | HDD OSD 1.10U | ROM 2.30 |
|---|---|---|
| Refracted lookup | 12.4 coordinates clamped to `0..W×16`, `0..H×16`; region clamp on the buffer | 1024 and 256 added, floor at 1024, no region clamp: strays up to 4.13 texels below the picture |
| Loaded textures other than the grain | clamp | repeat |
| Depth test in the texture binders | greater or equal | greater |
| Scene scale easing factor | 0.03 | 0.1 |
| Scene scale before the time is known | held at 0 | eased like any other frame |
| Refracted face header | one `CLAMP_1`: region clamp to the screen | two `CLAMP_1 0x1000000` |
| A split rod's grain | one packet for both pieces | one packet per face |
| Blur trips on the clock alone | 0 (`c < T ? 10 - c*10/T : 0`) | 5 before the rods (`5 + 5*clamp(T - c, 0, T)/T`) |
| Vignette's last sector | 6 vertices | 8 vertices |
| Glyphs | 12-vertex triangle fans | sprites |
| Cubes of System Configuration | always the ring of six | five standing cubes while the list has fewer than six entries |
| Opening: `CLAMP_1 = 0` in frame copy, blur and ghost | sent | not sent |
| Opening: length of the intro | 246 frames | 359 frames |

Everything else compared so far is the same code and gives the same values.

## Stimulated captures

Repeated on HDD OSD (`hddosd-110U-stim-*`): the hour turned in Clock Adjustment, the ramp and
angles written while paused, the sprites' fade falling and rising. The time keeper only corrects
the record when the console's second changes, so a record written to hh:59:59.9 runs on by
itself, turns the hour, and is pulled back within the second (measured on both builds).

## Not verified on either build

- Text on ROM 2.30: its button pictures, its trimming branch and languages other than English;
  languages other than English on either build beyond the captures of `text.md` section 5.
- The first-run intro's stage 3 (the settings pages), HDD OSD's stage 5, and the first run in PAL
  beyond HDD OSD's stages 0 to 2.
- Mode 1 of the overlay has no caller in either build.
- Text inside the whole-frame model on ROM 2.30.
- Open items per page are listed in `README.md`.

## A known weakness of the scripts

The single-precision helper `f(a + b)` shared by the older verifiers rounds the double sum
toward zero; when one addend is below the other's double precision it is lost, which is not
what the EE does. It showed in three ROM 2.30 cubes of the intro; `References/model/opening-lib.mjs`
has an exact `add`, used by the `_v2` copies of the opening's verifiers. Verifiers without a
`_v2` copy keep the plain helper; every capture taken passes with it.
