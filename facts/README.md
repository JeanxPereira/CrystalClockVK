# Facts

Pages in this directory are the only notes in this repository meant to be relied on. Everything
under `docs/`, `context/` and the top-level `MEMORY.md` predates them and mixes builds.

Rules for a page here:

- It names the build every address belongs to. Two builds are in play: **HDD OSD 1.10U**
  (`hddosd.elf`, SHA-1 `e932f3508313e2807467a0f354acc56869ea77f6`), the canon build, with the
  CrystalOSD symbols; and **ROM 2.30** (BIOS `0230AC20080220`; `0230EC20080220` in PAL), the build
  run live in Watson.
- It says how each statement is known: *verified* (a script recomputes it bit for bit from inputs
  a trace probe recorded; the script and a capture are named), *measured* (seen in a capture, not
  recomputed), *read* (from disassembly, with the address range).
- It names the script or tool that produced its numbers, so they can be produced again.
- A measured number is not a constant until what writes it has been read. A page records the rule
  that produces a value, not only the value: a number seen in one capture may be eased, depend on
  the video mode, or differ between builds (the scene scale and the vertical proportion both do).
- It states what the system is, in present tense; a later measurement replaces the statement it
  corrects.

| Page | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `verification.md` | Every verifier, what it covers and its result on each build; the regression suite; where the builds differ |
| `clock-function-map.md` | Which HDD OSD function each ROM 2.30 clock function corresponds to |
| `clock-state.md` | How the time becomes the current rod, the angles, the progress and the colours |
| `clock-camera.md` | View and screen matrices, scale and proportion, sines, rod and orb placement |
| `clock-scene.md` | How a frame is assembled: the depth-sorted draw list, measured rod parameters |
| `clock-rod-draw.md` | What the rod drawing function computes, pass by pass |
| `clock-extra-passes.md` | The two reflection passes over the rods |
| `clock-orbs.md` | An orb's trail, ring and sprites |
| `clock-frame.md` | End to end: a model that produces every packet of the rods, orbs, extra passes, background, blur, overlays and System Configuration's cubes of a frame from the frame's inputs, carried frame to frame |
| `clock-frame-rest.md` | The rest of a clock frame: the background tube, blur trips, copies and tint, fade overlay, vignette, bars; text only as which function sends what |
| `clock-transitions.md` | The timeline: entering the clock scene, menu to System Configuration and back, leaving, the first-run path, the options dialog, exits for the drive's codes |

| `clock-textures.md` | Where the textures come from and what each one is |
| `config-cubes.md` | The glass cubes of System Configuration: the rods' pipeline with a cube mesh; placement, ring, pulse |
| `text.md` | The font file, the glyph cache, a glyph's twelve-vertex fan, the string filter, alpha and place of each string |
| `pal.md` | How each build decides PAL, every value that changes with the video mode and its rule, the verifiers' results on real PAL runs |
| `opening.md` | The boot intro (module `opening`): frame map, timeline, cubes, lights, fog, logo, towers and their VU1 microprogram, ROM 2.30, PAL, the hand-off, the illegal-disc scene |
| `hddosd-boot.md` | Why HDD OSD would not start in the emulator, and how it is started here |
| `data/rod-mesh.json` | The rod's mesh from the HDD OSD file: 16 faces; equal in both builds |

Measured pages about ROM 2.30 live with the instrument: `Watson/docs/findings/`.

The patent (US 6,693,606, `docs/clock_patent/`) states the intent and agrees with what was
measured: twelve blocks, the hour picks the block, the minutes are a filling that starts full
and runs down, the ring turns, light spots circle a sphere and leave tracks. It holds no
numbers; those come only from the binary. Two leads not read yet, from psdevwiki's OSDSYS page:
patents JP2001154772A (display method) and JP2001148032A (image plotting).

A way to drive the clock for a capture: System Configuration, Clock Adjustment. While a field
is being edited the seconds are held at 0, the orbs gather at the centre, and up or down on the
hour field turns the hour (`watson_gif_trace {hold: ["up"]}` records it from the first frame).

## How to work here

- Skills in `.claude/skills/`: `measure` (one function to a verifier to a fact), `capture` (taking
  a capture from the emulator), `facts-page` (the page contract), `campaign` (many questions at
  once), `commit` (explicit paths, message form).
- Agents in `.claude/agents/`: `re-scout` (read-only scout of one question), `verifier-writer`
  (one verifier, mutation, manifest entries), `re-refuter` (re-runs one claim), `doc-writer`
  (one facts page).
- `node References/scripts/run_all.mjs` runs the regression suite (`run_all.manifest.json`);
  `node References/scripts/mutate.mjs <verifier>` checks a verifier fails when its arithmetic is
  changed; `node References/scripts/lint_facts.mjs facts/<page>.md` must end `FOUND` after every
  edit of a page.

## What is left before implementation

The Vulkan side comes next: a GS backend tested pixel for pixel against PCSX2's software renderer
replaying the GS dumps, with the verifiers as the tests of each module. The regression suite
(`node References/scripts/run_all.mjs`) passes 849 of 849 entries (2026-10-03). The frame model
(`clock-frame.md`) produces every packet of the clock frame, of System Configuration, the main
menu, Clock Adjustment, the transitions and the configuration item 0 on both builds (HDD OSD's
text included; ROM 2.30's text is `verify_text2.mjs`'s), and every `whole2` and `whole3` capture
ends `FOUND`.

What the pages list as open, deliberately, one line each, grouped by page:

**`clock-frame.md`**
- ROM 2.30 value tables by language: the jump table at `0x002C4920` is read in two orders that
  disagree for languages 3 to 6; settled by `dump_ee.mjs` on a ROM 2.30 capture.
- How a setting reaches item 0 beyond the confirm callback; the gate written by cross in is met
  by no capture.
- ROM 2.30's aspect value table (`0x0028ACE0`) is not read; its confirm of a changed aspect value
  is neither modelled nor captured.
- The generic editor, the enter callback and the gate writers outside the entry list are not
  modelled and not met.
- ROM 2.30 in PAL has the main menu into System Configuration only; PAL item 0 rows are verified
  on HDD OSD only.
- The leaving-entry drawing and the cancel's time guard are not modelled and not met.
- Strings are probed, not derived; a string running out of packet room is met by no capture.
- Overlay modes 1 and 4: which code sets them (the captures write the mode word).
- Not met in a capture: a confirmed value's pulse, a send with no face on one side of a rod,
  orb mode 2 on ROM 2.30, a transition other than the main menu into System Configuration on ROM
  2.30 in PAL, the time record's year, month, day and zone words.

**`clock-frame-rest.md`**
- Overlay mode 1's white colour and what sets modes 1, 3 and 4.
- PAL values of the ramp lengths, `ay` and the text scaling are read; the PAL whole-frame
  captures equal the model.
- The pages function beyond its blur trips; ROM 2.30's vignette sector function in full.

**`clock-transitions.md`**
- The reset in `func_00234B88` is never seen; overlay mode 1 has no caller.
- First-run stage 5 on HDD OSD is read, not compared; stage 3 (the settings pages) is not
  computed by `verify_first_run.mjs`; the PAL first run is captured to stage 2 on HDD OSD only.
- The regression suite does not hold `hddosd-110U-flow-pal-fr-logos`, the four
  `*-flow-exit72*.log` logs or `rom-0230E-pal-clock-written`.
- PAL hour carry: no script compares the carry itself; the wrap from 23 to 0 is not exercised.
- The buffers between sends (section 4e) are readings, not verifiers.

**`text.md`**
- ROM 2.30's trimming branch (`0x0020CBA0`, `0x0020CE44`) is reported, not reproduced.
- ROM 2.30 PAL constants in `romPlace` have no mutation run on the PAL captures.
- ROM 2.30 button pictures (NTSC and PAL) are not compared; its pages' load at start-up is not
  traced.
- The Japanese BIOS capture `hddosd-110U-text2-ja-boot` is empty (one reported hang, not
  reproduced); a Japanese console's layout row 0 is not verified.
- Font blocks 1, 3 and 5, decorations and a line break are reached by no clock string.
- Languages: video mode 0's path of `config_get_osd_language`, field values of 8 or more, the
  language entry's save path, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and Dutch at the menu and at boot.
- `clock_text.mjs` takes the date and time strings from the probe and the caller's string id from
  the capture; ROM 2.30 has no frame model of text.
- Soft-double rounding in `DrawIcon`'s PAL branch is not distinguishable by any capture.
- The Browser's text.

**`pal.md`**
- ROM 2.30 PAL: `verify_trail_fill.mjs` and `verify_first_run.mjs` not run.
- HDD OSD PAL first run: only stages 0 to 2 captured.
- Hour carry in PAL: no script compares it; 23 to 0 is not exercised.
- Text in PAL: soft doubles modelled as IEEE; ROM 2.30 PAL button pictures not compared; no
  language other than English in PAL.
- `verify_opening3_illegal_v2.mjs` on the PAL capture: 31 of 177 mutants survive.

**`opening.md`**
- The hand-off's wait on exec 0 is entered and not left inside a capture.
- Hard-disk words not exercised (exec values, the ready word cleared during a run, the drive
  state machine at `0x002083B0`).
- The meaning of the sound command ids.
- The illegal scene's end wait: disc states other than 0x64, 0x72 and 0x74 are read, not captured;
  the tile fade branch `z < 672` is not reached.
- The ROM CDDA count's second store (`0x0020FDB0`) is known from a watchpoint only.
- Mutation coverage of the stage verifiers is not complete.
- PAL towers: the captures cover the state's start and the dive's end, not every frame between.
- The fade's 'W' mode; verifiers without a `_v2` copy keep the plain arithmetic helper.

**`clock-scene.md`**
- The sorted insertion and the depth key are not recomputed on their own.

**`clock-state.md`**
- The time keeper by recomputation; who reads the hour-hand and second-hand globals.

**`clock-camera.md`**
- Which menu event calls each of the three configuration callbacks.
- The code of orb modes 2 and 3 is read only as far as the targets and the colours.

**`clock-rod-draw.md`, `clock-extra-passes.md`**
- Which side of the rod flag 0 is; the float-to-unsigned conversion of the reflection
  coordinates below zero.

**`clock-gs-state.md`**
- The helpers that bind the display buffer, copy, blur and overlay are not compared call by call.

**`clock-textures.md`**
- Where `TEXCSMOK` and `TEXCSTSL` are drawn; the font's textures.

**`config-cubes.md`**
- What each send does to the pixels is a reading; no picture was compared.
- The placement vector's fourth word; the blur chain's own rule apart from `verify_frame.mjs
  --carry`; the font draws on that screen.
